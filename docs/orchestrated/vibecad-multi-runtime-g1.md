## 1. Context

### 1.1 User goal

VibeCAD is a local-first expert CAD Agent kernel callable by Claude, Codex and
other host Agents. It must let a user create or modify a design through a
reviewable workflow without contaminating the source model. The near-term
product must expose that workflow inside FreeCAD, while the architecture must
not require a Task Kernel, Revision, public-tool or Workbench rewrite when a
second CAD system is added later.

The immediate cross-session goal is:

1. introduce a small generic multi-runtime foundation;
2. make CAD itself a multi-runtime domain while connecting only FreeCAD now;
3. adapt the current FreeCAD worker behind that boundary without changing
   public behavior;
4. deliver the G1 FreeCAD Workbench on the public Task Kernel client;
5. harden P0-B and verify real Claude/Codex hosts before P1 release;
6. add Mechanical3D breadth only after these boundaries are stable.

### 1.2 Verified repository state

- Repository: `/Users/wangtao/Documents/DevProject/vibecad`
- Branch: `codex/agent-stage3`
- Verified `HEAD`: `7d3c5252b076c53863049f7f6433c7e2db220d22`
- Verified upstream: `7d3c5252b076c53863049f7f6433c7e2db220d22`
- `HEAD` and upstream were equal when `MRG1-R0` was created.
- Latest commits:

  ```

- Preexisting untracked user/other-task file:
  `docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md`
  - size: `13,194` bytes;
  - lines: `231`;
  - SHA-256:
    `25b849b181cd7315cb148011bc82a7e829a4c80192cf0e00c1574ed0e30751f0`.
- The untracked research file is not part of `MRG1-R0`, must not be staged,
  overwritten or deleted, and is not yet a canonical product commitment.

### 1.3 Completed product baseline

P0-B core is complete at C00-C15. Its authoritative history and evidence remain
in `docs/orchestrated/vibecad-p0b-core.md`.

The completed baseline includes:

- one Task Kernel as Task, Revision, lease, review and commit authority;
- durable project/task/revision/draft/artifact state;
- isolated candidate mutation and source-file preservation;
- Accept, Reject and Revert;
- restart/recovery and HEAD compare-and-swap;
- active cancellation, killable FreeCAD worker generations and reconciliation;
- authenticated daemon, managed checkout and session-bound file grants;
- FCStd and STEP artifact delivery;
- MCP and Workbench backend clients routed through the same kernel;
- version `0.6.0`, runtime epoch `4`, FreeCAD `1.1.0`, MCP `1.27.2`;
- exactly `28` public tools.

Recorded P0-B final gates:

```text
full non-slow:       4902 passed, 108 deselected, 19 warnings
slow Worker/P0-B:      11 passed, 102 deselected
managed public matrix:  2 passed
fresh MCPB:             1 passed
M05 preservation:       1 passed
final review: Critical 0 / Major 0 / Medium 0 / Minor 0
```

These are closeout records, not a claim that `MRG1-R0` reran the suites.
Subsequent commits through `7d3c525` are documentation-only.

### 1.4 Honest current product state

The backend is a local `0.6.0` host-ready candidate. It is not yet a generally
deliverable CAD product because:

- no real Claude/Codex installation has completed canonical host verification;
- no FreeCAD Qt Workbench UI exists;
- G1 preview, verdict, selection and in-FreeCAD Accept/Reject are absent;
- Sketcher, PartDesign, stable face/edge selectors and general imported-model
  editing are absent;
- only six object-level CAD operations are implemented:
  `create_box`, `create_cylinder`, `inspect_model`, `modify_parameter`,
  `move_part`, and `rotate_part`;
- generic FCStd/STEP/STL import, STL-to-CAD reconstruction, photo reconstruction
  and simulation are not delivered;
- no `v0.6.0` tag, GitHub release or marketplace publication exists;
- P0-B retention/GC, runner migration, full operational observability/recovery,
  large-artifact transport and cross-platform evidence remain hardening work.

### 1.5 Known architectural pressure

`CadExecutionPort` is a useful application boundary but is not yet a
multi-CAD contract. Its current types require FCStd and STEP paths, fixed
artifact names, FreeCAD-oriented validation and the current local execution
profile. `WorkerCadExecutionPort` and the worker codec are also FreeCAD
specific. Adding PartDesign breadth directly to these assumptions would make a
future CAD adapter expensive.

### 1.6 Explicit exclusions for the next foundation stage

MR0 must not:

- connect or claim support for a second CAD product;
- implement photo/video reconstruction or simulation;
- create a second Task, Revision, lease, review or commit state machine;
- make Python or arbitrary generated code the primary public execution path;
- implement a universal lowest-common-denominator CAD API;
- silently convert a native model between CAD systems;
- publish a tag, release, PR or marketplace package;
- modify or adopt the untracked research document;
- expand G1 into face/edge editing, semantic diff or TaskPanel parameter tuning.

## 2. Decisions

### MRG1-D01 — One durable authority

The Task Kernel remains the only durable authority for Task state, Revision,
lease, review, Accept/Reject and HEAD commit. Runtime routing never receives
commit authority.

### MRG1-D02 — Two levels of multi-runtime

The architecture has two independent axes:

1. system runtime families such as CAD authoring, reconstruction and
   simulation;
2. multiple runtimes inside the CAD family, such as FreeCAD today and
   SolidWorks, Onshape, Fusion, AutoCAD or another CAD system later.

Only FreeCAD is connected in the current stage.

### MRG1-D03 — Generic lifecycle, domain-specific semantics

The generic runtime layer standardizes only:

- runtime identity, version and capability discovery;
- invocation ownership and Task correlation;
- sealed Revision and immutable Artifact inputs;
- deadlines, resource budgets and execution profile;
- start, status, cancel, health and reconcile;
- immutable output artifacts, provenance, diagnostics and evidence.

CAD commands, reconstruction requests and FEA studies remain different domain
contracts. They must not be forced into one union schema.

### MRG1-D04 — CAD domain boundary

CAD execution is split into:

```text
Task Kernel
  -> CAD Domain Service
  -> CAD capability planning
  -> CAD Runtime registry/router
  -> CAD Runtime adapter
  -> native CAD engine/API
```

The CAD Domain Service owns backend-neutral design intent. A runtime adapter
maps supported intent to one native API. The first adapter is FreeCAD.

### MRG1-D05 — Capability negotiation, not false portability

The common CAD vocabulary covers portable intent such as sketch, constraint,
pad, pocket, hole, fillet, chamfer, pattern, inspect and export. Each runtime
advertises versioned fine-grained capabilities. A planner must choose one of:

- execute natively;
- execute through an explicitly disclosed semantic mapping;
- propose an explicit approximation;
- reject as unsupported before mutation;
- use a namespaced runtime extension for non-portable features.

A capability declaration is evidence, not permission to bypass Task Kernel
validation.

### MRG1-D06 — Native artifacts are runtime-qualified

A Revision must not assume that its native model is always `model.FCStd`.
The intended model is:

```text
Revision
  authoring_runtime
  native_model_artifact
  exchange_artifacts
  semantic_observation
  selector_mapping
  provenance_and_evidence
```

FreeCAD may produce FCStd plus STEP today. A future CAD may use SLDPRT,
document/version references or another native representation. Moving between
authoring runtimes is an explicit conversion/import Task with its own evidence,
not an invisible change to the same Revision.

### MRG1-D07 — Dual selector representation

Persist both:

- a backend-neutral `SemanticSelector` expressing design intent or feature
  lineage; and
- a runtime-specific `NativeLocator` carrying the native persistent reference.

Public tools must not make ephemeral values such as `Face3` the sole durable
identity. Native locator loss triggers re-resolution and evidence, never
guessing.

### MRG1-D08 — FreeCAD adapter first, behavior preserved

The current FreeCAD worker is adapted behind the new CAD runtime boundary.
Existing public tools, Task states, source-safety rules and FCStd/STEP output
must remain behaviorally compatible during MR0. No new CAD breadth is required
to prove the architecture.

### MRG1-D09 — Workbench is a client

The G1 FreeCAD Workbench consumes the authenticated public client, HEAD/draft
resources and file grants. It is not a runtime router or a second authority.
If later GUI-thread CAD execution is needed, it is registered as a FreeCAD GUI
execution profile behind the same adapter and Task Kernel.

### MRG1-D10 — Read-only provider authority

Photo/mesh reconstruction and simulation runtimes consume sealed Revisions or
immutable artifacts and return immutable, provenance-bound artifacts or
proposals. They never commit a CAD Revision. A result that changes a design is
adopted through a new reviewed CAD Task.

### MRG1-D11 — Conformance before a real second runtime

MR0 must include deterministic fake runtime and fake CAD adapter conformance
tests. They must prove that a second runtime identity can register, advertise
capabilities, execute/cancel/reconcile within its declared lifecycle and return
artifacts without Task Kernel changes or commit authority.

### MRG1-D12 — Product milestone order

The intended order is:

1. MR0 generic and CAD multi-runtime foundation;
2. G1 Workbench, P0-B hardening and real-host verification in parallel;
3. P1/G2 Mechanical3D;
4. P1.5 engineering precheck;
5. P2 controlled simulation;
6. P3 enterprise and assembly/delivery;
7. P4 reconstruction providers and additional CAD adapters as demand warrants.

P0-B hardening must close before P1 is called deliverable.

### MRG1-D13 — Evaluation routing

Use the evaluation framework already committed to
`docs/PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md`:

- P0 Trust gates for current reliability;
- G1 preview/selection/review metrics;
- Text2CAD, HistCAD and neuralCAD-Edit subsets for P1/G2;
- DeCoDE CADBench for later photo/STL reconstruction;
- MUSE-style funnel for manufacturing and assembly.

Runtime conformance is an additional architectural gate and does not replace
CAD quality evaluation.

## 3. Proposed Commit Sequence

This sequence is a planning baseline, not implementation authority. A resumed
controller must audit the exact source topology, update this artifact to
`MRG1-R1`, prewrite exact affected tests and obtain one approval for that
revision.

| ID | Proposed commit | Scope | Independent gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C00 | `docs(architecture): define multi-runtime CAD contracts` | Canonical architecture/roadmap terms, authority diagram, runtime vs adapter vs provider | docs links, terminology search, review finds no second authority or delivered-runtime overclaim |
| MR0-C01 | `feat(runtime): add runtime capability contracts` | Runtime descriptor, identity, invocation/result envelope and lifecycle control ports; deterministic fake | focused RED/GREEN for identity, capability, budgets, cancel/reconcile, provenance and immutable results |
| MR0-C02 | `feat(cad): add backend-neutral CAD runtime port` | CAD runtime identity, native-model artifact, semantic/native selector envelope and namespaced capability model | focused RED/GREEN registers two fake CAD identities without Task Kernel or public-tool changes |
| MR0-C03 | `refactor(freecad): adapt worker to CAD runtime port` | FreeCAD adapter wraps current worker behavior; remove core assumptions only where required | existing FreeCAD worker/Task/revision/public-tool suites plus real managed FreeCAD smoke |
| MR0-C04 | `test(runtime): enforce adapter conformance` | Generic runtime and CAD adapter conformance kit, authority-negative cases and compatibility matrix | fake runtime/adapters pass; commit-bypass, unsupported capability and artifact mismatch cases fail closed |
| MR0-C05 | `docs(orchestration): close multi-runtime foundation` | Evidence, residuals, diagrams, developer adapter guide and recovery snapshot | full affected suite, full non-slow, selected real FreeCAD gates, independent architecture and diff reviews |

Follow-on campaigns are intentionally separate:

- `G1`: FreeCAD Qt Workbench Dock, HEAD/draft preview, verdict,
  stale/revoked rejection, Accept/Reject and object/feature capture.
- `P0BH`: retention/GC, runner upgrade/migration, operational recovery
  observability and large-artifact transport.
- `HOST1`: canonical real Claude and Codex host activation and task evidence.
- `P1/G2`: Sketcher, PartDesign, stable selectors, controlled import,
  STL-to-faceted-STEP and TaskPanel tuning.

## 4. Manual Validation Matrix

| ID | Environment and scenario | Expected observation | Owner / user presence |
|---|---|---|---|
| MRG1-M01 | Installed managed FreeCAD 1.1.0; run existing empty/direct/program candidate flow through the FreeCAD adapter | Same Task lifecycle and FCStd/STEP evidence as the P0-B baseline; source bytes unchanged | controller; user not required |
| MRG1-M02 | Register FreeCAD and a deterministic fake CAD runtime | Capability discovery selects only declared operations; unsupported intent fails before candidate mutation | controller; user not required |
| MRG1-M03 | Cancel and lose a fake runtime invocation, then restart/reconcile | One durable Task lineage converges without a second job authority or duplicate execution | controller; user not required |
| MRG1-M04 | Review Revision manifest emitted by FreeCAD adapter | Runtime-qualified native FCStd and STEP exchange artifacts have hashes, provenance and selector evidence | independent reviewer; user not required |
| G1-M01 | FreeCAD GUI with future Workbench | User sees HEAD and draft, verdict and stale/revoked status, then Accept or Reject without source pollution | user useful for product acceptance, not required for mechanical gate |
| HOST1-M01 | Real Claude/Codex host | Host discovers capabilities, completes one canonical task and receives FCStd/STEP resources | user required only for subscription-host activation if the host demands it |

## 5. Budget and Circuit Breakers

### 5.1 Proposed limits

- MR0 implementation budget: at most six semantic commits including docs
  closeout.
- One semantic concern per commit; no opportunistic P1 or G1 implementation.
- No more than one generic runtime lifecycle abstraction and one CAD runtime
  domain abstraction.
- Preserve the existing public protocol and 28-tool projection unless a later
  approved revision explicitly changes them.

### 5.2 Circuit breakers

Stop implementation and append evidence if any of these becomes observable:

- Task Kernel, Revision or Accept/Reject logic must be duplicated per runtime;
- the common runtime layer imports FreeCAD, FCStd, Qt, FEA or reconstruction
  domain types;
- a runtime or provider can advance HEAD directly;
- adapting FreeCAD requires changing public tool semantics or losing current
  artifact/source-safety guarantees;
- a proposed common CAD operation is only a disguised FreeCAD object/property
  API;
- selectors rely solely on unstable runtime-native face/edge indices;
- a second CAD is claimed supported without real adapter and native-engine
  evidence;
- an unexpected tracked or untracked path appears;
- the preexisting research file changes hash without explicit user ownership;
- focused tests, real FreeCAD smoke, full non-slow suite, diff review or
  repository integrity is red;
- scope requires external spend, credentials, publication, force-push or an
  irreversible external action.

At a breaker, preserve the workspace and evidence. Do not reset, rewrite,
force, hide or automatically expand the allowlist.

## 6. Proposed File Allowlist

The exact implementation allowlist must be narrowed in `MRG1-R1` after source
audit. Its maximum proposed envelope is:

```text
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
docs/PRODUCT_CAPABILITY_ROADMAP.md
docs/PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md
docs/ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md
docs/orchestrated/vibecad-multi-runtime-g1.md
src/vibecad/runtime/**
src/vibecad/interaction/cad.py
src/vibecad/execution/**
src/vibecad/worker/**
src/vibecad/workflow/**
src/vibecad/application/**
tests/**
```

Restrictions:

- broad directory entries are discovery envelopes, not permission for unrelated
  cleanup;
- `MRG1-R1` must list the exact paths per commit before implementation;
- packaging/version/public tools remain out of scope unless an approved
  revision adds exact files and compatibility gates;
- `docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md` is explicitly denied.

## 7. Expected Impact

### 7.1 Intended impact

- no user-visible behavior change during MR0;
- no change to the sole Task Kernel or source-safety workflow;
- FreeCAD becomes the first registered CAD adapter instead of a core
  assumption;
- future CAD support is primarily an adapter, capability mapping, selector
  mapping and conformance effort;
- G1 remains runtime-neutral at its public-client boundary;
- future reconstruction and simulation can reuse lifecycle/provenance
  infrastructure without receiving CAD authority.

### 7.2 Expected test impact

- new focused contract and conformance tests;
- updates to tests that construct `CadExecutionPort` directly;
- existing Task Kernel, workflow, worker, MCP and public-tool tests should
  remain green;
- managed FreeCAD tests must continue producing exact native/exchange evidence;
- no expected reduction in test count or weakening of negative assertions;
- full baseline counts may increase, but any disappearance or skip increase is
  a breaker until explained.

### 7.3 First user-visible outcome after MR0

G1 must let a user:

1. connect the FreeCAD Workbench to a VibeCAD project;
2. see current HEAD and the isolated Agent draft;
3. inspect the verdict and stale/revoked state;
4. Accept or Reject inside FreeCAD;
5. receive a new Revision and FCStd/STEP on Accept;
6. observe no source-file mutation on Reject or failure.

## 8. Residuals

| ID | Evidence | Impact | Owner | Disposition / closure condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MRG1-RES-01 | `CadExecutionPort` currently requires FCStd/STEP-specific validation and names | Multi-CAD adapter would leak FreeCAD assumptions | MR0 | close when native artifacts and CAD adapter contract are runtime-qualified and existing behavior passes |
| MRG1-RES-02 | No generic runtime registry/invocation/result conformance exists | Reconstruction/simulation or another CAD could create parallel lifecycle logic | MR0 | close with C01/C04 conformance and authority-negative tests |
| MRG1-RES-03 | No FreeCAD Qt Workbench UI | Ordinary user cannot review inside CAD | G1 | close with G1 visual/manual acceptance |
| MRG1-RES-04 | Real Claude/Codex host not verified | host-ready is not host-verified | HOST1 | close with canonical task/resource evidence from each claimed host |
| MRG1-RES-05 | P0-B hardening residuals remain | blocks P1 deliverable claim | P0BH | inherit authoritative IDs from P0-B; close before P1 release |
| MRG1-RES-06 | Research document is untracked and not canonical | product validation/simulation direction may diverge from committed strategy | user/product review | preserve exact file; close only by explicit adopt/revise/discard decision |
| MRG1-RES-07 | No second CAD adapter exists | architecture is conformance-ready, not multi-CAD product support | later demand-led stage | close only with a real adapter, engine evidence and product acceptance |
| MRG1-RES-08 | No photo/STL reconstruction or simulation runtime | advanced workflow remains reserved only | P1.5/P2/P4 | close per a separately approved provider/runtime stage |

## 9. Authorization History

| ID | Time | Artifact revision | Scope | Exact user authorization | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MRG1-A00 | 2026-07-26T01:17:24Z | MRG1-R0 | Documentation-only state persistence and handoff | `状态持久化一下  我新开一个会话执行接下来的计划` | completed when this artifact is written and verified; no implementation authority |

Earlier product-direction wording preserved as input to this artifact:

```text
包括 把多 runtime 的架构提前埋好
cad 也需要做好多 runtime 的工作 当然目前仅接入 freecad
主要不想以后接其他 cad 工具的时候 需要大返工
```

## 10. Capability Profile and Adapter Selection

Selected adapter: Codex desktop.

```text
approval: native-plan
delegation: spawn-send-wait
persistence: repo-artifact
process: native-session-poll
```

Execution restriction for `MRG1-A00`: perform the handoff serially. No
implementation delegation is needed, and no subagent claim is made.

Permitted capability evidence categories:

- `live capability declarations`: `update_plan`, collaboration
  spawn/message/wait operations, `exec_command`, `write_stdin` and
  `apply_patch` are declared in the current session.
- `observable behavior`: `update_plan`, synchronous read-only commands and
  `apply_patch` calls return observable results in the current session; no
  long-running session was needed for this documentation packet.
- `environment identity`: Codex desktop exposes repository
  `/Users/wangtao/Documents/DevProject/vibecad`, macOS workspace context,
  branch context and current date/time passively.
- `public configuration`: Git exposes branch/upstream configuration read-only;
  no other public configuration evidence was observed.

No credentials, tokens, keys, secrets, repository contents or prior approval
artifacts are classified as capability evidence.

## 11. Recovery Snapshot MRG1-S00

### 1. Completed milestones

- P0-B C00-C15 is closed and pushed; product/package end is
  `157d33f89386499dfbf3d589cd8a57ffffcde434`; orchestration closeout is
  `50d78033b45e7eaeace991702346244a98d558f0`.
- Product/backend strategy consolidation is
  `7eb4b3a92a937e005509d75b8d6b111b134a9350`; the unified product report is
  `16c45d9204ac5f5eb044a5f79c04971103d56fad`; CAD Agent evaluation is
  `7d3c5252b076c53863049f7f6433c7e2db220d22`.
- At snapshot creation, `HEAD` and upstream are both `7d3c525...`.
- P0-B recorded gates remain `4902` non-slow, `11` slow, `2` managed,
  `1` MCPB and `1` preservation test; final review is `0/0/0/0`.
- Artifact revision `MRG1-R0` persists the current product state,
  MRG1-D01..D13, proposed MR0-C00..C05 and the next campaign boundary.
- The preexisting untracked research file is preserved at
  `25b849b181cd7315cb148011bc82a7e829a4c80192cf0e00c1574ed0e30751f0`.

### 2. Next steps

1. In the new session, read this artifact completely and inspect
   `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD`,
   `git rev-parse @{upstream}` and the research-file hash.
2. If `HEAD=upstream=7d3c525...` and porcelain contains only the research file
   plus this handoff artifact, continue with a read-only MR0 source/test audit.
   Do not treat the handoff file itself as an implementation approval.
3. If the branch advanced only by a commit containing this exact handoff
   artifact, record the new commit as a documentation anchor and continue the
   read-only audit. If it advanced for another reason, inspect and append a
   recovery correction before planning.
4. If the research hash differs, preserve it as user-owned state, do not edit
   it, and append the observed hash/status before proceeding.
5. Produce `MRG1-R1` with exact per-commit file allowlists, focused RED/GREEN
   commands, real FreeCAD gates, independent reviews and implementation
   circuit breakers.
6. Present one meaningful approval: “introduce the multi-runtime and
   multi-CAD foundation while preserving all current FreeCAD behavior and
   public tools.” Do not request approval for internal interruptions already
   covered by the approved packet.
7. After approval, execute MR0-C00..C05. Then create separate bounded packets
   for G1, P0-B hardening and real-host verification.

Observable branches:

- unexpected tracked changes: stop before implementation and preserve them;
- only known user-owned untracked research: continue read-only planning around
  it;
- MR0 requires public behavior change: breaker, revise artifact and reapprove;
- FreeCAD compatibility gate red: preserve evidence and repair only inside the
  approved MR0 allowlist;
- need for external credentials, spend or publication: stop for user authority.

### 3. Approved decisions

- `MRG1-A00` authorizes only creation and verification of this handoff
  artifact.
- Product direction carried into the next plan is MRG1-D01..D13:
  one Task Kernel; generic runtime lifecycle; CAD-domain multi-runtime;
  FreeCAD-only current adapter; runtime-qualified native artifacts; dual
  selectors; capability negotiation; Workbench as client; providers without
  commit authority; conformance before a real second runtime.
- No MR0/G1/P0BH/HOST1 code implementation, PR, tag, release, publication,
  external installation or spend is authorized by `MRG1-A00`.
- The untracked mechanical validation research remains independent and is not
  adopted by this artifact.

### 4. Execution discipline

- Capability profile:
  `native-plan / spawn-send-wait / repo-artifact / native-session-poll`.
- Adapter: Codex desktop; authoritative persistence:
  `docs/orchestrated/vibecad-multi-runtime-g1.md`.
- Current documentation-only allowlist is exactly this artifact. The existing
  research file is denied.
- Handoff gates: exact artifact existence/content, Markdown whitespace check,
  `git diff --check`, porcelain inspection, verified HEAD/upstream equality and
  research hash preservation.
- Implementation gates and allowlists remain proposals until `MRG1-R1`.
- Circuit breakers and residual rules are Sections 5 and 8.
- Recovery commands:

  ```text
  git status --short --branch
  git rev-parse HEAD
  git rev-parse @{upstream}
  git log -5 --oneline
  shasum -a 256 docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md
  git diff --check
  ```

- Never reset, rewrite, force, hide or absorb user-owned changes. Never infer
  implementation continuity from chat memory; recover from Git and this
  artifact.

## 12. MRG1-R1 MR0 Source Audit

### 12.1 Recovery result

MRG1-S00 was recovered without relying on chat memory:

- branch: `codex/agent-stage3`;
- recovered `HEAD` and upstream:
  `04045da62822af964e04140b43620469d2841c61`;
- the only commit after the old `7d3c525...` anchor is
  `04045da docs(orchestration): hand off multi-runtime foundation`;
- `git show --name-status 04045da...` proves that commit added only this
  artifact;
- the only remaining untracked path is
  `docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md`;
- that file remains `13,194` bytes, `231` lines and SHA-256
  `25b849b181cd7315cb148011bc82a7e829a4c80192cf0e00c1574ed0e30751f0`;
- the user's new wording,
  `未跟踪的机械验证研究文档找机会一起提交`, authorizes an exact,
  non-opportunistic documentation inclusion in MR0-C00. It does not turn the
  report's P1/P2 directions into committed delivery scope.

No unexpected tracked or untracked path was observed.

### 12.2 Current source topology

The audit found four distinct boundaries that must not be conflated:

1. `src/vibecad/runtime/` currently means managed FreeCAD installation,
   receipt, status and platform selection. It has no generic provider
   identity, invocation/result envelope, lifecycle port or registry.
2. `src/vibecad/interaction/cad.py` defines the nominal
   `CadExecutionPort`, but the contract combines CAD-domain execution with a
   FreeCAD-shaped lifecycle:
   - `ExecutionProfile` is described as closed FreeCAD surfaces;
   - import and materialization evidence are FCStd/STEP-specific;
   - `CandidateEvidence` requires exactly `model.FCStd` then `model.step`;
   - `validate_materialization()` takes named `fcstd` and `step` paths;
   - `export_step()` is part of the core execution port.
3. `src/vibecad/execution/worker_port.py` is already the concrete
   FreeCAD/process boundary. It owns worker generation fencing, opaque
   candidate/revision capabilities, cancellation, validation, checkpoint,
   STEP export, reload and evidence collection. It is the correct component to
   adapt; the Task Kernel must not learn worker RPC details.
4. `src/vibecad/execution/revisions.py` is a large crash-consistent durable
   store with fixed FCStd/STEP layout throughout import, candidate creation,
   sealing, manifest validation, copy, recovery and reconciliation. The audit
   counted `67` direct `model.FCStd`/`model.step` occurrences in this file and
   `18` source modules containing one or both names.

The authority chain remains sound:

```text
AgentApplication
  -> project-scoped TaskService
  -> CandidateCoordinator + CadExecutionPort
  -> LocalRevisionStore
  -> HEAD compare-and-swap
```

`TaskService` auto-commit and `accept_draft()` both converge on
`CandidateCoordinator.commit()`, the sole caller of
`LocalRevisionStore.commit_revision()` and HEAD advancement.
`WorkerCadExecutionPort` is the trusted application-owned parent; it retains
the existing store/lease capabilities only for bounded candidate/revision
validation, checkpoint/export/reload and evidence, and its adapter methods do
not call commit, Accept/Reject or HEAD mutation. The child Worker codec/service
receive no store/lease objects or daemon credentials, and their closed
protocol exposes no commit, review or HEAD method.

### 12.3 Selector and operation findings

- `SelectorV1` is already revision-bound and backend-neutral at object/feature
  level: it carries project/revision, VibeCAD UUIDs, type, semantic role,
  provenance and exact cardinality.
- It intentionally has no face/edge locator and never falls back to FreeCAD
  labels or ephemeral sub-element indices.
- MR0 therefore must wrap the existing semantic selector in a dual
  semantic/native adapter envelope without changing the public SelectorV1
  wire contract. A native locator may strengthen execution evidence but may
  not replace semantic identity.
- The operation registry already separates allowlisted semantic commands from
  handlers, but `ExecutionProfile` still combines runtime product and
  execution mode. MR0 adds runtime identity/capability planning around the
  registry; it does not add a seventh public CAD operation.

### 12.4 Composition findings

- `_default_cad_port_factory()` in
  `src/vibecad/application/project.py` is the narrow default composition seam.
- `AgentApplication` lazily constructs one port through that factory and
  serializes it behind the existing CAD gate.
- `build_project_runtime()` and `TaskService` accept the nominal
  `CadExecutionPort`; preserving that nominal boundary allows a CAD Domain
  Service/router to be inserted without changing Task, Revision, review,
  Accept/Reject or public-tool behavior.
- Project bootstrap and artifact validation also consume the same nominal
  port. The FreeCAD adapter must continue to expose the exact validation
  behavior until durable artifact migration is separately approved.

### 12.5 Audit baseline evidence

Commands were run from
`/Users/wangtao/Documents/DevProject/vibecad` at
`04045da62822af964e04140b43620469d2841c61`.

| Evidence ID | Command / result |
|---|---|
| MRG1-GA01 | `pytest ...` from the bare shell: exit `127`, global `pytest` absent; did not enter tests |
| MRG1-GA02 | locked local environment, five affected files: `375 passed, 23 deselected in 19.29s` |
| MRG1-GA03 | full non-slow: `4902 passed, 108 deselected, 19 warnings in 156.42s` |
| MRG1-GA04 | `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src tests`: exit `0`, `All checks passed!` |
| MRG1-GA05 | managed FreeCAD worker load/modify/checkpoint/export: `1 passed in 8.74s` |
| MRG1-GA06 | Task Kernel slow gate with `VIBECAD_FREECAD_ENV` override: setup error, correctly rejected before product path |
| MRG1-GA07 | same Task Kernel gate against the current managed generation, no override: `1 passed in 4.82s` |

The two setup failures are preserved as environment evidence, not counted as
product regressions or RED tests.

### 12.6 Audit conclusion

MR0 can safely establish and connect the multi-runtime boundary without
rewriting the durable revision store. It cannot honestly close the whole
fixed-artifact migration in six commits. Doing so would couple a new
architecture boundary to high-risk persistence/recovery changes and violate
the stage budget.

MRG1-D06 is therefore split:

- MR0 makes runtime identity, capability planning, invocation lifecycle,
  runtime-qualified artifact profiles and dual selector envelopes generic,
  then maps the existing FreeCAD FCStd/STEP layout through the adapter.
- `MR1` will migrate `RevisionRef`, candidate/revision storage, artifact
  materialization and recovery from fixed filenames to a versioned durable
  artifact profile. Until MR1 closes, a second native CAD format cannot be
  persisted and no second CAD support may be claimed.

## 13. MRG1-R1 Approved-When-Authorized Stage Contract

### 13.1 Context and success criteria

MR0 succeeds only if:

1. generic runtime contracts express immutable identity, capabilities,
   invocation ownership, Task correlation, sealed inputs, budget/deadline,
   lifecycle, immutable result artifacts, provenance, diagnostics and
   evidence without importing CAD, FreeCAD, Qt, FEA or reconstruction types;
2. the CAD domain adds backend-neutral runtime identity, capability decisions,
   runtime-qualified artifact profiles and semantic/native selector envelopes;
3. two deterministic fake CAD identities can register and plan independently
   without any Task Kernel or public-tool change;
4. the current worker is selected as the FreeCAD adapter through a CAD Domain
   Service/router at the default composition seam;
5. every existing FreeCAD lifecycle, source-safety, FCStd/STEP result,
   cancellation and recovery behavior remains green;
6. the public surface remains exactly `28` tools and no second CAD is claimed;
7. the mechanical validation research is committed as direction research,
   explicitly not as a promised MR0/P1/P2 feature.

Explicit exclusions remain G1 UI, P0-B hardening, HOST1 activation, new CAD
operations, face/edge editing, durable artifact schema migration, a real
second CAD, reconstruction, simulation, publication, release, external spend
and credentials.

### 13.2 Additional decisions

#### MRG1-D14 — Adapter-first durable migration split

MR0 routes the current fixed durable layout through a runtime-qualified
FreeCAD adapter. `RevisionRef` and `LocalRevisionStore` remain unchanged in
MR0. MR1 is the only stage allowed to generalize their durable schema.

Rationale: preserve proven crash consistency and isolate architecture risk
from persistence migration risk.

#### MRG1-D15 — Public compatibility projection

The public `SelectorV1`, six operations, `CadExecutionPort` behavior and
28-tool surface remain compatibility projections during MR0. New runtime
identity, native locators and artifact profiles are internal adapter/domain
contracts until a separately versioned public protocol is approved.

#### MRG1-D16 — Mechanical research status

`docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md` is accepted into source control
as a product-direction research artifact. Its existing statement that it does
not constitute committed scope remains authoritative. MR0 may cross-link it
but may not implement its P1/P1.5/P2 roadmap.

### 13.3 Exact commit sequence

| ID | Commit | Exact scope | Independent gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C00 | `docs(architecture): define multi-runtime CAD boundary` | update canonical architecture/strategy/roadmap/acceptance terms; add the already-written mechanical validation research; no executable code | named-file allowlist, relative-link check, terminology/overclaim search, `git diff --check`, distinct docs review |
| MR0-C01 | `feat(runtime): add runtime capability contracts` | immutable generic runtime descriptor, capability, invocation/result, artifact/provenance, lifecycle status/control port and deterministic registry | genuine import/contract RED; focused immutable/strict/duplicate/budget/cancel/reconcile GREEN; common layer import-purity check |
| MR0-C02 | `feat(cad): add backend-neutral CAD runtime port` | CAD runtime descriptor, capability decision, artifact profile, semantic/native selector envelope, adapter registry/router and domain service | genuine RED; two fake CAD identities plan without Task Kernel edits; unsupported/mapping/approximation/extension branches are exact and mutation-free |
| MR0-C03 | `refactor(freecad): route worker through CAD runtime adapter` | make current worker port the FreeCAD adapter; compose it through the CAD Domain Service at the existing default factory; preserve old nominal port | focused composition RED/GREEN; affected 375-test baseline; public 28-tool checks; managed worker and Task Kernel real gates |
| MR0-C04 | `test(runtime): enforce adapter conformance` | reusable generic runtime and CAD adapter conformance kits; authority-negative, artifact mismatch and unsupported capability cases | deterministic fake runtime/adapters pass; commit/HEAD-like authority, runtime/artifact mismatch, sole ephemeral selector and undeclared capability fail closed |
| MR0-C05 | `docs(orchestration): close multi-runtime foundation` | developer adapter guide, acceptance evidence, residuals, ledger and recovery snapshot | full non-slow, ruff, exact slow gates, public-surface count, diff/allowlist, architecture and adversarial review |

No implementation commit may start until its predecessor is pushed and its
ledger row is appended. The stage budget remains exactly six commits.

evidence. No broad `src/**`, `tests/**` or `docs/**` allowance remains.

### 13.5 Prewritten RED/GREEN and gate commands

All Python gates use the existing locked `.venv`; a bare global `pytest`
command is prohibited.

MR0-C01 RED/GREEN:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_runtime_contracts.py tests/test_runtime_registry.py
```

MR0-C02 RED/GREEN:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_runtime_contracts.py tests/test_runtime_registry.py \
  tests/test_cad_runtime.py
```

MR0-C03 focused compatibility:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_cad_execution_port.py tests/test_execution_adapter.py \
  tests/test_freecad_worker.py tests/test_task_service.py \

  -m "not slow"
```

MR0-C03 real FreeCAD:

```text
VIBECAD_MANAGED_FREECAD_PYTHON="<current managed python>" \
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -m slow \
  tests/test_freecad_worker.py::test_real_managed_worker_load_modify_checkpoint_and_export

  tests/test_task_kernel_integration.py::test_real_agent_first_public_matrix_and_cross_process_review
```

No `VIBECAD_FREECAD_ENV` override is permitted for the Agent-first Task Kernel
gate; it must use the current managed generation.

MR0-C04 conformance:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_runtime_contracts.py tests/test_runtime_registry.py \
  tests/test_cad_runtime.py tests/test_runtime_conformance.py \
  tests/test_cad_runtime_conformance.py tests/test_runtime_purity.py
```

MR0-C05 final:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src tests
git diff --check
```

Each behavior commit must first produce a genuine focused RED caused by the
missing intended contract or route. Import errors are acceptable only for a
new, deliberately absent module; syntax/setup/dependency failures are not RED
evidence. Every GREEN records exit status, count and relevant descriptor/hash
facts in the ledger.

### 13.6 Manual validation matrix

| ID | Environment / scenario | Expected observation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| MRG1-M01 | current managed FreeCAD 1.1.0 through FreeCAD adapter | exact candidate lifecycle, reload, FCStd/STEP hashes and source preservation remain | controller |
| MRG1-M02 | FreeCAD plus deterministic fake CAD descriptors | only declared capability is planned; fake identity does not become delivered support | controller review |
| MRG1-M03 | cancel, lose and reconcile deterministic runtime invocation | one Task correlation and one runtime invocation converge without commit authority or duplicate execution | controller review |
| MRG1-M04 | FreeCAD adapter artifact/selector evidence | native FCStd and exchange STEP are runtime-qualified; semantic selector remains authoritative and no bare Face/Edge index is durable | distinct review pass |
| MRG1-M05 | docs and mechanical research | research is discoverable and cross-linked but still says “not committed scope”; no simulation delivery claim | product review |

The user is not required for mechanical validation during MR0. Product
acceptance remains G1-M01.

### 13.7 Budgets and circuit breakers

The existing Section 5 breakers remain active, plus:

- any required edit to `src/vibecad/execution/revisions.py`, revision manifest
  schema, candidate store layout or recovery journal stops MR0 and opens MR1;
- any public protocol/schema/tool-count change stops before implementation;
- any adapter method can write HEAD, accept/reject a Task or obtain daemon
  credentials;
- the generic runtime layer imports `vibecad.interaction`, CAD, FreeCAD, Qt,
  FEA or reconstruction modules;
- the CAD common layer imports FreeCAD, FCStd-specific implementation types or
  worker codec/proxy/service modules;
- the FreeCAD adapter changes an existing error code, artifact name/format,
  task transition, cancellation outcome or source-preservation invariant;
- any fake runtime is described as product support;
- the mechanical research file changes product status or scope wording beyond
  link/format corrections;
- an unexpected path appears, a gate is unexpectedly red, the full test count
  decreases, deselections/warnings increase without exact explanation, or the
  six-commit budget is exceeded.

At a breaker, preserve the workspace, append evidence and stop. Do not expand
the allowlist or weaken assertions in the same packet.

### 13.8 Expected impact

Expected implementation impact:

- new internal runtime and CAD-domain modules plus conformance fixtures;
- one changed default composition seam;
- new FreeCAD adapter metadata and delegation;
- zero public tool, Task state, Revision schema, artifact payload or
  user-visible behavior change;
- test count increases; existing `4902` non-slow tests remain present;
- no version, runtime epoch, manifest or package change.

Expected first user-visible product outcome remains G1: in-FreeCAD HEAD/draft
preview, verdict, stale/revoked state and Accept/Reject. MR0 is valuable
because that client stays attached to one Task Kernel while future runtimes
remain replaceable behind the CAD Domain Service.

### 13.9 Residual revisions

| ID | Evidence | Impact | Owner / closure |
|---|---|---|---|
| MRG1-RES-01A | durable revision/candidate/artifact store still fixes FCStd/STEP in 18 modules after MR0 | second native CAD cannot persist yet | MR1; versioned schema migration with crash/recovery matrix |
| MRG1-RES-06A | mechanical validation report is now approved for source control as research | direction is discoverable but hypotheses remain unvalidated | product research; user studies or separately approved stage |
| MRG1-RES-09 | public `ExecutionProfile` remains a compatibility projection | public protocol does not expose runtime identity yet | later versioned public protocol; no change in MR0 |

MRG1-RES-01 is superseded by the narrower MR0 adapter closure and
MRG1-RES-01A durable migration. MRG1-RES-06 closes when MR0-C00 commits the
unchanged research status; MRG1-RES-06A remains.

## 14. MRG1-R1 Implementation Approval Gate

### 14.1 Product-meaningful approval to present

The implementation authorization must be explicit and bind this exact
revision. The proposed wording is:

```text
我批准 MRG1-R1：在保持当前 28 个公共工具、Task/Revision/Accept/Reject
唯一权威、源文件安全以及 FreeCAD 的 FCStd/STEP 行为完全兼容的前提下，
执行 MR0-C00..C05，引入通用多 runtime 生命周期、CAD 多 runtime
能力规划与路由、运行时限定产物和双选择器契约，并把当前 FreeCAD Worker
接到该 adapter 边界；同时将机械详细设计与仿真验证调研作为“方向研究、
非已承诺功能”纳入源码。此次批准不包含 durable RevisionStore schema
迁移、第二 CAD 支持、G1 UI、新建模能力、仿真、发布、外部安装、费用或凭据。
```

This approval produces a product-relevant architecture outcome: future CAD
runtimes can be planned and adapted without duplicating Task Kernel authority,
while current users keep exactly the trusted FreeCAD behavior they have.

### 14.2 Authorization state

`MRG1-A01` is reserved for the user's exact approval of Section 14.1.

State: `awaiting user approval`.

No executable source, test, research file or canonical product document may be
edited under MRG1-A01 until that approval is received. After approval, all
MR0-C00..C05 packets inherit it and must not ask again unless scope, authority,
irreversibility or an observable circuit breaker changes.

## 15. MRG1-R1 Capability Profile and Adapter Selection

Selected adapter: Codex desktop.

```text
approval: native-plan
delegation: serial
persistence: repo-artifact
process: native-session-poll
```

Permitted capability evidence categories:

- `live capability declarations`: `update_plan`, `exec_command`,
  `write_stdin` and `apply_patch` are declared in the current session.
  Collaboration tools are also declared, but the current higher-priority
  session rule prohibits proactive subagent spawning unless the user or an
  applicable instruction explicitly asks for it; this campaign therefore
  selects `serial`.
- `observable behavior`: `update_plan` updated the native projection;
  `exec_command` returned controllable sessions `63194`, `65389`, `29405`,
  `30011` and `99321`; `write_stdin` polled each original session through
  real completion without relaunch.
- `environment identity`: Codex desktop passively exposes the macOS workspace,
  repository root, current date/time and America/Los_Angeles timezone.
- `public configuration`: read-only Git configuration exposes branch
  `codex/agent-stage3` and upstream `origin/codex/agent-stage3`; no other
  relevant public configuration was observed.

No repository content, artifact approval, credential, token, key, secret or
private memory is classified as capability evidence.

The native plan is only a projection. This artifact remains authoritative.
Serial execution still requires a distinct review pass and all per-commit
gates.

## 16. Recovery Snapshot MRG1-S01

### 1. Completed milestones

- Recovered S00 at
  `HEAD=upstream=04045da62822af964e04140b43620469d2841c61`.
- Verified the only post-S00-anchor commit contains this handoff artifact.
- Completed MR0 source/test audit and appended artifact revision `MRG1-R1`.
- Reproduced full non-slow baseline:
  `4902 passed, 108 deselected, 19 warnings`.
- Reproduced affected baseline: `375 passed, 23 deselected`.
- Ruff is green; managed FreeCAD worker and Task Kernel selected gates are
  each `1 passed`.
- Research file remained unchanged at
  `25b849b181cd7315cb148011bc82a7e829a4c80192cf0e00c1574ed0e30751f0`.
- No MR0 implementation commit has been created or authorized.

### 2. Next steps

1. Verify the R1 doc-only diff, links, whitespace, Git porcelain and research
   hash.
2. Present Section 14.1 to the user and wait for explicit approval.
3. On exact approval, append MRG1-A01, set state to `executing`, create the
   seven-section MR0-C00 packet and execute serially.
4. For each C00..C05: genuine RED where applicable, minimal GREEN, exact
   allowlist review, named staging, independent review pass, commit, push and
   ledger append.
5. Close MR0 only after final full/real gates and MRG1-S02.

Observable branches:

- user requires durable schema migration now: supersede D14, expand budget and
  reapprove before code;
- user changes research status to committed feature scope: new product
  decision and approval;
- approval wording changes but preserves scope: append exact wording to A01;
- any breaker in Section 13.7: stop, append evidence and request only the new
  authority needed.

### 3. Approved decisions

- MRG1-A00 remains documentation-only and completed.
- MRG1-D01..D13 remain active subject to D14's explicit MR0/MR1 split.
- MRG1-D14..D16 are proposed at R1 and become active only with MRG1-A01.
- MRG1-A01 is not yet granted.

### 4. Execution discipline

- Capability profile:
  `native-plan / serial / repo-artifact / native-session-poll`.
- Adapter: Codex desktop; artifact:
  `docs/orchestrated/vibecad-multi-runtime-g1.md`.
- Pre-approval write allowlist is exactly this artifact.
- Approved implementation allowlists, gates and breakers are Sections
  13.4–13.7.
- Preserve and poll original long-running sessions; never detach or relaunch.
- Stage only exact named files; never use `git add .` or `git add -A`.
- Push each accepted commit before the next.
- Recovery checks:

  ```text
  git status --short --branch
  git rev-parse HEAD
  git rev-parse @{upstream}
  git log -5 --oneline
  shasum -a 256 docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md
  git diff --check
  ```

## 17. MRG1-A01 Authorization and Execution Re-evaluation

### 17.1 Authorization record

| ID | Time | Artifact revision | Decisions / packets | Exact user authorization | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MRG1-A01 | 2026-07-26T01:37:10Z | MRG1-R1 | MRG1-D01..D16; MR0-C00..C05 | `批准  另外启动子 agent  编码过程 和 调研过程 都使用  sol max 的推理强度` | approved / executing |

MRG1-A01 binds the product-meaningful scope in Section 14.1 and additionally
requires subagents for both research and coding, with the host model selector
set to `gpt-5.6-sol` and reasoning effort `max`. This does not expand the file
allowlist, product scope, external authority, publication rights or circuit
breakers.

The earlier `awaiting user approval` statement in Section 14.2 is historical
and is superseded by this append-only authorization record. The same approval
must not be requested again unless an approved boundary changes or a circuit
breaker requires new authority.

### 17.2 Re-evaluated capability profile

Selected adapter: Codex desktop.

```text
approval: native-plan
delegation: spawn-send-wait
persistence: repo-artifact
process: native-session-poll
```

Permitted capability evidence categories:

- `live capability declarations`: `update_plan`, `spawn_agent`,
  `send_message`, `followup_task`, `wait_agent`, `exec_command`,
  `write_stdin` and `apply_patch` are declared in the current session; the
  user explicitly requested subagents, so the prior proactive-delegation
  restriction no longer prevents this bounded route.
- `observable behavior`: `update_plan`, `exec_command`, `write_stdin` and
  `apply_patch` have returned observable results in this session; subagent
  spawning and messaging are declared but have not yet been exercised at this
  re-evaluation point.
- `environment identity`: Codex desktop passively exposes the macOS workspace,
  repository root, current date/time and America/Los_Angeles timezone.
- `public configuration`: read-only Git configuration exposes branch
  `codex/agent-stage3` and upstream `origin/codex/agent-stage3`; no other
  relevant public configuration was observed.

No repository content, artifact approval, task packet, credential, token, key,
secret or private memory is classified as capability evidence.

Subagent model tier is `deep`; the adapter-local selection is explicitly
overridden by MRG1-A01 to `gpt-5.6-sol` with `max` reasoning for both research
and coding. Shared-file implementation remains serialized. The controller
retains approval traceability, artifact/ledger writes, gate verification,
distinct review, exact staging, commit and push.

### 17.3 Immediate packet order

1. `MR0-RSCH-01`: read-only, independent architecture and product-claim
   research against MRG1-R1; no writes.
2. `MR0-C00-IMPL`: documentation implementation excluding the controller-owned
   rolling artifact; no commit or push.
3. Controller verifies both returns, incorporates the artifact ledger, assigns
   a distinct review and closes MR0-C00.
4. Coding and review packets for MR0-C01..C05 proceed in dependency order;
   research packets may overlap only when read-only and file-independent.

## 18. MRG1-A02 Subagent Routing Amendment

| ID | Time | Artifact revision | Scope | Exact user authorization | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MRG1-A02 | 2026-07-26T01:39:48Z | MRG1-R1 | subagent model/reasoning routing and gate delegation only | `后续  出一些门禁执行也启动 subagent  纯机械验证可用 gpt-5.6-terra / medium，常规编码可用 sol / high，关键架构与对抗复核用 sol / max` | active; supersedes only A01's uniform model routing |

MRG1-A02 does not alter the approved product scope, allowlist, commit budget,
gates or external authority. It refines packet routing:

```text
mechanical gate execution: gpt-5.6-terra / medium
routine coding:            gpt-5.6-sol / high
critical architecture:     gpt-5.6-sol / max
adversarial review:        gpt-5.6-sol / max
```

The already-running MR0-C00 documentation packet may complete at
`gpt-5.6-sol / max`; interrupting it is not required. Subsequent packets use
the refined route. Gate subagents execute exact commands and return raw
evidence without editing, staging, committing or pushing. The controller
independently verifies command identity, exit status, counts, repository
state, exact staging, commit and push.

## 19. MR0-C00 Execution Ledger and Recovery Snapshot MRG1-S02

### MR0-C00 outcome before commit

At `2026-07-26T02:02:30Z`, MR0-C00 implementation and review are complete and
ready for exact staging:

- implementation subagent: `gpt-5.6-sol / max`;
- independent architecture/product research and settled-diff review:
  `gpt-5.6-sol / max`;
- mechanical gate and targeted recheck: `gpt-5.6-terra / medium`;
- exact changed scope: the five tracked canonical product/architecture docs,
  this rolling artifact and the previously untracked mechanical research doc;
- executable/config changes: `0`;
- `git diff --check`: exit `0`;
- scoped relative Markdown links: `21` checked, `0` broken;
- research SHA-256:
  `25b849b181cd7315cb148011bc82a7e829a4c80192cf0e00c1574ed0e30751f0`;
- independent review: Critical `0`, Major `0`, Medium `0`, Minor `0`;
- FreeCAD remains the sole connected adapter; C00 is documentation-only and
  does not claim MR0 foundation readiness.

Two review findings in the controller-owned artifact were corrected before
PASS: the pre-approval statement is now historical and superseded by A01, and
the trusted parent compatibility adapter is distinguished from the
store/lease-free child Worker/provider protocol.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C00-E01 | D01..D16; A01; A02 | `not-created`; exact staging next | C00-G0: diff check 0; links 21/0; allowlist 7/7; research hash matched; review 0/0/0/0 | MRG1-RES-10 | MRG1-S02 | gated / ready-to-commit |

MRG1-RES-10: `README.md` retains the pre-MR0 milestone order at the audited
baseline but is outside the approved C00 allowlist. It does not invalidate the
named canonical-document gate. Closure requires a separately approved
documentation update; until then, do not claim repository-wide documentation
consistency.

### 1. Completed milestones

- Repository remains on `codex/agent-stage3` at pre-C00
  `04045da62822af964e04140b43620469d2841c61`.
- MRG1-A01 approved MRG1-R1; A02 refined subagent routing.
- C00 canonical documentation, research adoption, G0 gates, independent review
  and targeted recheck are complete.
- No source, test, package, public schema, version or runtime behavior changed.
- C00 commit and push have not yet occurred at this snapshot.

### 2. Next steps

1. Stage exactly the seven named C00 paths.
2. Inspect cached name-status, stat and diff; rerun `git diff --cached --check`.
3. Commit `docs(architecture): define multi-runtime CAD boundary`.
4. Push `codex/agent-stage3` immediately and verify local/upstream equality.
5. Append the exact C00 hash/push state in the next rolling artifact entry,
   then issue MR0-C01.

Observable branches:

- staged path outside C00 allowlist: unstage only that exact path, preserve the
  workspace and stop;
- commit hook/gate red: preserve output, do not bypass;
- push rejection or remote advance: inspect and reconcile without force;
- research hash drift: stop before commit.

### 3. Approved decisions

- MRG1-D01..D16 are active under MRG1-A01.
- MRG1-A02 controls subagent routing only.
- C00 adopts the mechanical document as direction research, not committed
  feature scope.
- D14 keeps durable FCStd/STEP migration in MR1.

### 4. Execution discipline

- Capability profile:
  `native-plan / spawn-send-wait / repo-artifact / native-session-poll`.
- C00 exact allowlist is Section 13.4; no broad staging is permitted.
- Stage named files only; commit and push are controller-owned.
- Active breakers and residual rules are Sections 13.7 and 13.9.
- Recovery commands remain:

  ```text
  git status --short --branch
  git rev-parse HEAD
  git rev-parse @{upstream}
  shasum -a 256 docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md
  git diff --check
  ```

## 20. MR0-C00 Gate-Red Record and Corrective Packet

### MR0-C00-E02 — staged whitespace gate red

The exact named staging exposed a condition that the earlier worktree check
could not observe while the research file was untracked:

```text
git diff --cached --check
exit 2
docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md:3: trailing whitespace
docs/MECHANICAL_DESIGN_VALIDATION_RESEARCH.md:4: trailing whitespace
```

Both lines use two trailing spaces as implicit Markdown hard breaks. The
research content and approved noncommitment status are unchanged, but this is
an unpredicted G0 red. It is preserved here and is not waived or relabeled.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C00-E02 | D16; A01; A02 | `not-created`; staged attempt retained | C00-G0 staged diff check exit 2 at research lines 3–4 | none; exact format defect | MRG1-S02 | blocked / corrective packet required |

### MR0-C00-FIX01 — explicit Markdown formatting

1. **Authorization:** MRG1-R1/D16 under A01 permits link/format corrections
   without changing the report's product status or feature scope. No new
   product authority is required.
2. **Workspace anchor:** same C00 anchor and exact allowlist; correction may
   modify only the research document and this controller-owned artifact.
3. **Context:** replace two invisible trailing-space hard breaks with explicit
   blockquote paragraph separators; do not alter research prose.
4. **Steps and gates:** apply the two-line mechanical format change, record
   old/new hashes, restage those two named files, rerun exact staged allowlist,
   `git diff --cached --check`, relative links, overclaim search and
   independent mechanical recheck.
5. **Execution discipline:** controller applies the narrow correction;
   `gpt-5.6-terra / medium` reruns mechanical gates. Stop on any semantic
   research diff or further red.
6. **Delivery boundary:** no commit or push until the corrective gate passes.
7. **Final report:** exact diff, hashes, commands, exit status, path list and
   final staged state.

### MR0-C00-FIX01 GREEN

- new research SHA-256:
  `2b5df222751f6fa6ecdb70a8671ce904ae7e95f02799b92af6a9fac025e4255e`;
- mechanical reconstruction of only the two explicit blockquote separators
  reproduces the old SHA-256
  `25b849b181cd7315cb148011bc82a7e829a4c80192cf0e00c1574ed0e30751f0`;
- research prose and noncommitment status are unchanged;
- `git diff --cached --check`: exit `0`;
- exact staged allowlist: `7` paths;
- relative Markdown links: `21` checked, `0` broken;
- unstaged paths: `0`; untracked paths: `0`;
- mechanical corrective gate: PASS.

## 21. MR0-C00 Finalization and MR0-C01 Task Packet

### 21.1 MR0-C00 accepted commit

At `2026-07-26T02:13:05Z`, the controller verified and pushed the accepted
documentation boundary:

- commit:
  `6cc1876c8a76c9e3498262c78a0ad2c4ec6ddf6c`;
- subject: `docs(architecture): define multi-runtime CAD boundary`;
- push: `origin/codex/agent-stage3`, success;
- local `HEAD` and upstream:
  `6cc1876c8a76c9e3498262c78a0ad2c4ec6ddf6c`;
- post-push worktree: clean;
- exact accepted scope: seven C00 paths, including the formerly untracked
  mechanical validation research document;
- final independent review: Critical `0`, Major `0`, Medium `0`, Minor `0`;
- residual: MRG1-RES-10 remains open and does not authorize a `README.md`
  change in MR0.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C00-E04 | D01..D16; A01; A02 | `6cc1876c8a76c9e3498262c78a0ad2c4ec6ddf6c`; pushed | corrective gate PASS; architecture/adversarial review 0/0/0/0; local/upstream equal | MRG1-RES-10 | MRG1-S03 | accepted / closed |

### 21.2 MR0-C01 seven-section implementation packet

#### 1. Authorization

MRG1-A01 authorizes MRG1-R1 and MR0-C01. MRG1-A02 routes routine coding to
`gpt-5.6-sol / high`, architecture/adversarial review to
`gpt-5.6-sol / max`, and mechanical gate execution to
`gpt-5.6-terra / medium`. No new product approval is required.

#### 2. Workspace anchor and exact write scope

Start from clean pushed commit
`6cc1876c8a76c9e3498262c78a0ad2c4ec6ddf6c` on
`codex/agent-stage3`. The implementation subagent may write only:

```text
src/vibecad/runtime/contracts.py
src/vibecad/runtime/registry.py
tests/test_runtime_contracts.py
tests/test_runtime_registry.py
```

`src/vibecad/runtime/__init__.py` remains in the approved commit allowlist but
should stay unchanged unless a test-proven import requirement appears. This
avoids an unnecessary additive package surface. The rolling artifact is
controller-owned and must not be edited by subagents.

#### 3. Context and required behavior

Build the domain-neutral foundation only: immutable runtime identity and
descriptor, declared capabilities, invocation ownership/correlation with
sealed input, budget/deadline, lifecycle status/control port, immutable result
artifacts/provenance/diagnostics/evidence, and a deterministic registry.
The common layer must not import CAD, FreeCAD, Qt, FEA, reconstruction,
application or public-tool modules. It must not change Task Kernel, durable
revision layout, public schemas, public operation projection or the 28-tool
surface.

#### 4. Test-first steps and gates

1. Create tests that specify immutability, strict validation, stable ordering,
   duplicate rejection, budget/deadline behavior, cancellation/reconciliation
   control and immutable artifact/provenance results.
2. Run the approved focused command before implementation and preserve a
   genuine RED caused by the deliberately absent contracts/registry.
3. Implement only enough generic code to satisfy the contract.
4. Rerun:

   ```text
   PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
     tests/test_runtime_contracts.py tests/test_runtime_registry.py
   ```

5. Run scoped Ruff, `git diff --check`, exact allowlist and a common-layer
   forbidden-import search. A distinct `sol / max` reviewer checks architecture
   and authority boundaries; a `terra / medium` gate agent reruns exact
   mechanical commands.

#### 5. Execution discipline and breakers

Implementation is serialized in the shared worktree. Subagents do not stage,
commit, push or edit this artifact. The controller owns the ledger, exact named
staging, commit and immediate push. Stop on any required change outside the
C01 allowlist, public/API surface expansion, persistence migration, Task
Kernel edit, non-determinism, real external runtime requirement, or gate red
that cannot be resolved by a narrow C01 correction.

#### 6. Delivery boundary

The intended commit is exactly:

```text
feat(runtime): add runtime capability contracts
```

It may contain only the four implementation/test paths above plus this rolling
artifact; `src/vibecad/runtime/__init__.py` may be added only if the recorded
test evidence makes it necessary. No commit or push occurs until focused
GREEN, purity evidence, independent review and mechanical recheck all pass.

#### 7. Required final report

Return the RED cause and exit status, GREEN commands and counts, exact files
changed, contract decisions, forbidden-import result, scoped Ruff/diff status,
review findings by severity, residuals and whether `runtime/__init__.py`
remained unchanged. The controller then records the accepted hash/push state
before issuing MR0-C02.

## 22. MR0-C01 Test-First Ledger, Review Red and Corrective Packet

### 22.1 Initial RED and focused GREEN

The `gpt-5.6-sol / high` implementation subagent obeyed the exact write scope
and test-first order:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_runtime_contracts.py tests/test_runtime_registry.py
```

- genuine RED before source implementation: exit `2`; both test modules
  failed collection with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vibecad.runtime.contracts'`;
- the environment and test parsing were healthy, and the missing modules were
  deliberately absent C01 targets;
- initial GREEN after implementation: exit `0`, `18 passed in 0.10s`;
- scoped Ruff lint and format check: PASS;
- source forbidden-import search: `0` matches;
- `git diff --check` and explicit trailing-whitespace scan: PASS;
- exact implementation paths: the two new runtime modules and two new test
  modules; `src/vibecad/runtime/__init__.py` remained unchanged;
- no stage, commit or push occurred.

This focused GREEN was necessary but not sufficient for acceptance.

### 22.2 MR0-C01-E02 — independent architecture/adversarial review red

At `2026-07-26T02:31:19Z`, the distinct `gpt-5.6-sol / max` review returned
FAIL with Critical `0`, Major `1`, Medium `4`, Minor `0`:

1. **Major:** `RuntimeControlPort` exposes only status, cancel and reconcile,
   while approved D03 requires start, status, cancel, health and reconcile.
   An immutable invocation value does not grant adapter start authority.
2. **Medium:** six mapping-root fields rely on `assert`; under `python -O`,
   descriptor/artifact metadata, invocation payload and result output probes
   accepted list roots as tuples.
3. **Medium:** a descriptor accepts execution profile `Headless GUI`, while an
   invocation rejects it, so discovery can advertise an unusable route.
4. **Medium:** a result may return artifacts with no provenance, contrary to
   the approved provenance-bound artifact boundary.
5. **Medium:** frozen JSON limits depth and numeric range but not traversal
   nodes, collection width or string/key bytes; probes accepted a
   100,000-item sequence and a one-million-character string.

Registry duplicate/unknown behavior, exact-version lookup, deterministic
lexical ordering, domain purity, file scope and the unchanged package
`__init__.py` otherwise passed review.

Controller probes independently reproduced the first three findings:

```text
python -O mapping-root probes:
descriptor_metadata ACCEPTED tuple
artifact_metadata   ACCEPTED tuple
invocation_payload  ACCEPTED tuple
result_output       ACCEPTED tuple

RuntimeControlPort methods:
cancel, get_status, reconcile
```

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C01-E01 | D01..D16; A01; A02 | `not-created` | genuine import RED exit 2; initial focused GREEN 18; Ruff/diff/purity PASS | none | MRG1-S03 | implemented / review pending |
| MR0-C01-E02 | D01..D16; A01; A02 | `not-created`; forbidden | independent review 0/1/4/0; optimized-mode and protocol probes reproduced | none; five exact defects | MRG1-S03 | blocked / corrective packet required |

The review red is preserved and is not waived or relabeled.

### 22.3 MR0-C01-FIX01 — lifecycle, validation and bounded-freeze correction

#### 1. Authorization

MRG1-D03, D06 and the C01 strict/immutable/budget gates already require these
behaviors under MRG1-A01. MRG1-A02 keeps routine correction coding at
`gpt-5.6-sol / high`, adversarial re-review at `gpt-5.6-sol / max` and final
mechanical gates at `gpt-5.6-terra / medium`. No product scope expands.

#### 2. Workspace anchor and write scope

The pushed anchor remains
`6cc1876c8a76c9e3498262c78a0ad2c4ec6ddf6c`. The correction may change only
the existing four C01 source/test paths; this artifact remains
controller-owned. `src/vibecad/runtime/__init__.py` must remain unchanged.

#### 3. Exact corrective behavior

- add Protocol-only `start(RuntimeInvocation)` plus immutable, domain-neutral
  runtime health state/snapshot and `health(RuntimeIdentity)`;
- replace every assertion-based mapping-root check with explicit stable
  rejection that remains active under optimized Python;
- use one strict execution-profile grammar for descriptor and invocation;
- require matching provenance whenever a result contains artifacts;
- bound frozen JSON depth, per-container width, total traversed nodes and
  UTF-8 bytes for strings/keys, rejecting cycles and hostile containers
  deterministically before unbounded materialization.

#### 4. Test-first steps and gates

Add negative and lifecycle tests first, then run the focused command and
preserve a corrective RED attributable to the five findings. Implement the
narrow correction, rerun the exact focused suite, scoped Ruff/format,
`git diff --check`, optimized-mode mapping probes, bounded-container probes and
forbidden-import search.

#### 5. Execution discipline and breakers

The implementation subagent remains the sole source/test writer. It must not
edit the artifact, stage, commit or push. Stop if correction needs a public
schema, CAD/domain import, Task Kernel/persistence edit, clock/random source,
third-party dependency or path outside C01.

#### 6. Delivery boundary

The original C01 commit subject and exact commit budget remain unchanged. No
commit occurs until all five review findings have regression coverage, the
focused suite is GREEN and the same `sol / max` reviewer plus an independent
`terra / medium` gate agent both return PASS.

#### 7. Required final report

Return corrective RED failures/count, final GREEN count, exact contract
changes and bounds, optimized-mode evidence, hostile/cyclic evidence,
Ruff/diff/purity results, exact paths and any residual. The controller records
the old red, correction and re-review separately.

### 22.4 MR0-C01-FIX01 result and MR0-C01-E03 re-review red

FIX01 preserved a second test-first transition:

- corrective RED before source changes: exit `1`,
  `6 failed, 19 passed in 3.91s`;
- all five E02 findings were represented, including a controlled two-second
  timeout for the previously unbounded infinite JSON `Sequence`;
- no timed-out child process remained;
- focused GREEN: exit `0`, `25 passed in 2.44s`;
- optimized/hostile targeted subset: `4 passed`;
- scoped Ruff/format, diff/whitespace and forbidden-import gates: PASS;
- implemented bounds: depth `32`, `1,024` items per JSON container, `8,192`
  nodes per root, and `65,536` UTF-8 bytes per individual string/key;
- lifecycle, optimized-root, profile-grammar and artifact-provenance findings
  were closed.

The `gpt-5.6-sol / max` re-review at `2026-07-26T02:44:33Z` nevertheless
returned FAIL with Critical `0`, Major `0`, Medium `3`, Minor `0`:

1. the UTF-8 limit is per string/key, not aggregate; `1,024` references to one
   individually valid `65,536`-byte string produced a passing
   `67,108,864`-byte logical value;
2. `_typed_tuple` and `_text_tuple` still exhaust arbitrary caller
   `Sequence` objects before validation; controlled endless profile and
   capability sequences timed out;
3. `RuntimeRegistry` still calls `tuple()` on a public `Iterable`; a controlled
   endless generator timed out.

All timeout subprocesses were terminated. The controller independently
reproduced the endless profile sequence and registry generator with one-second
timeouts. No stage, commit or push has occurred.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C01-FIX01-E03 | D03; D06; A01; A02 | `not-created` | corrective RED 6/19; GREEN 25; targeted 4; Ruff/diff/purity PASS | none | MRG1-S03 | corrected / re-review pending |
| MR0-C01-E03 | D03; D06; A01; A02 | `not-created`; forbidden | re-review 0/0/3/0; 67,108,864 logical bytes; two controlled iterable timeouts | none; three boundedness defects | MRG1-S03 | blocked / FIX02 required |

The second review red is preserved and is not waived or folded into FIX01.

### 22.5 MR0-C01-FIX02 — cumulative and iterable bounds

#### 1. Authorization

C01's approved strict, immutable and resource-bounded input contract already
covers these three defects under D03/A01. A02 routes the narrow correction to
`gpt-5.6-sol / high`, re-review to `gpt-5.6-sol / max` and final mechanical
gate execution to `gpt-5.6-terra / medium`.

#### 2. Workspace anchor and exact scope

The pushed anchor remains
`6cc1876c8a76c9e3498262c78a0ad2c4ec6ddf6c`. Only the same four C01
source/test paths may change; the artifact is controller-owned and
`src/vibecad/runtime/__init__.py` remains unchanged.

#### 3. Exact corrective behavior

- add one cumulative UTF-8 byte counter to the shared per-root freeze budget
  and count every logical string value and mapping key, including repeated
  references;
- replace unbounded tuple/text `Sequence` conversion with incremental
  `limit + 1` enumeration that ignores untrusted length hints and rejects
  excess, endless and failing iterators deterministically;
- apply an explicit finite descriptor count to registry enumeration using the
  same incremental pattern before materialization;
- retain all FIX01 depth, width, node, individual string/key, cycle and
  provenance/lifecycle behavior.

#### 4. Test-first steps and gates

Add aggregate-byte, endless typed/text sequence and endless registry-generator
tests before source edits. Run the focused suite and preserve a FIX02 RED.
Implement narrowly, then rerun the exact focused suite, controlled timeout
probes, scoped Ruff/format, optimized-root tests, `git diff --check` and
forbidden-import search.

#### 5. Execution discipline and breakers

The coding subagent remains sole source/test writer and may not stage, commit,
push or edit this artifact. No clock, process-control implementation,
third-party dependency, domain import or path expansion is allowed. Every
bounded iterator must stop after at most its declared limit plus one item.

#### 6. Delivery boundary

The original C01 commit subject and six-commit stage budget remain unchanged.
Commit is forbidden until FIX02 GREEN, a third settled-diff `sol / max`
review PASS and independent `terra / medium` mechanical PASS.

#### 7. Required final report

Return the FIX02 RED count, final GREEN count, cumulative byte and collection
bounds, controlled timeout outcomes, exact paths, Ruff/diff/purity evidence,
process cleanup and residuals.

### 22.6 MR0-C01-FIX02 GREEN and accepted pre-staging gates

FIX02 completed within the same four source/test paths:

- genuine FIX02 RED before source edits: exit `1`,
  `6 failed, 25 passed in 6.58s`;
- controlled failures covered aggregate UTF-8, endless capability/profile
  sequences, explicit contract collection size, explicit registry size and
  endless registry enumeration; all subprocesses were cleaned;
- final focused GREEN: exit `0`, `31 passed`;
- final bounds:
  - JSON depth `32`;
  - per JSON container `1,024` items;
  - per frozen root `8,192` nodes;
  - per string/key `65,536` UTF-8 bytes;
  - cumulative logical string/key bytes per frozen root `1,048,576`;
  - every non-JSON contract `Sequence` `1,024` items;
  - runtime registry `256` descriptors;
- all collection and registry snapshots enumerate incrementally and reject
  after at most `limit + 1` reads without trusting `len()` or length hints.

The third settled-diff `gpt-5.6-sol / max` review returned PASS:
Critical `0`, Major `0`, Medium `0`, Minor `0`. It verified exact boundary
acceptance/rejection, repeated key/value byte accounting, iterator read
counts/failures, all prior lifecycle/provenance/optimized-mode closures,
authority purity and an unchanged package `__init__.py`.

The independent `gpt-5.6-terra / medium` pre-staging mechanical gate also
returned PASS with no deviations:

```text

### 23.2 MR0-C02 architecture audit

The read-only `gpt-5.6-sol / max` C02 design audit returned PASS with no
breaker. It confirmed:

- the existing revision-bound, backend-neutral `SelectorV1` is the semantic
  selector authority and must be wrapped without changing its wire schema;
- the five capability outcomes require distinct immutable sum-type variants,
  not one optional-field record;
- a narrow adapter selection Protocol declares only a runtime descriptor,
  `generation_lost`, `terminate_generation()` and `close_generation()`; it
  does not inherit `RuntimeControlPort` or invent a second invocation state
  machine;
- C03 can construct one `WorkerCadExecutionPort`, register it, select it
  through the router for internal capability
  `authoring.execute_program@1`, assert the selected object is the same
  nominal worker and return it unchanged;
- `src/vibecad/interaction/__init__.py` should remain byte-identical with
  SHA-256
  `f1e9b6e50b2042c09dff60d024a6fbf53ee09f2507b6b66dfa0423de9ae776a5`.

### 23.3 MR0-C02 seven-section implementation packet

#### 1. Authorization

MRG1-A01 authorizes C02 under D01–D15. MRG1-A02 routes routine coding to
`gpt-5.6-sol / high`, architecture/adversarial review to
`gpt-5.6-sol / max`, and mechanical gates to
`gpt-5.6-terra / medium`. The packet introduces internal CAD-domain contracts
only and does not change public product support.

#### 2. Workspace anchor and exact write scope

Start from clean pushed commit
`07c6d6cd0260dcce41711a4a92d47132460571db`. The implementation subagent may
write only:

```text
src/vibecad/interaction/cad_runtime.py
tests/test_cad_runtime.py
```

The rolling artifact is controller-owned.
`src/vibecad/interaction/__init__.py` remains in the approved commit allowlist
but must stay unchanged unless a test-proven import requirement appears; in
that case stop instead of editing it.

#### 3. Context and required internal design

Implement a backend-neutral internal CAD runtime layer:

- `CadRuntimeIdentity` wraps an exact generic `RuntimeIdentity` whose family
  is `cad`;
- `CadRuntimeExtension` makes non-portable requests explicit and
  runtime-qualified;
- five frozen decision variants represent native execution, disclosed
  semantic mapping, explicit non-executable approximation, mutation-free
  unsupported rejection and namespaced runtime extension; only native,
  mapping and extension are executable;
- native requires the exact requested declared capability; mapping and
  extension selections must also be declared; approximation/unsupported carry
  no executable selection, and an unknown request becomes unsupported before
  any adapter lifecycle call;
- `CadArtifactProfile` contains runtime-qualified, versioned role/kind/media
  declarations with exactly one native model; validating a concrete generic
  `RuntimeArtifact` requires exact runtime, kind and media type. It contains no
  path, fixed FCStd/STEP filename, store or durable schema field;
- `CadSelectorEnvelope` contains the existing revalidated `SelectorV1` as
  mandatory semantic authority plus an optional exact-runtime/revision
  `NativeLocator`; dropping the native locator preserves semantic identity,
  and a bare ephemeral locator can never stand alone;
- `CadRuntimeDescriptor`, a bounded deterministic adapter registry, router and
  `CadDomainService` provide exact-version planning and adapter selection for
  two independently registered fixture identities;
- `CadRuntimeAdapter` is a structural selection/compatibility Protocol with
  only `runtime_descriptor`, `generation_lost`,
  `terminate_generation()` and `close_generation()`. It exposes no store,
  lease, Task, revision, review, Accept/Reject, commit, HEAD or public-tool
  authority and remains separate from generic `RuntimeControlPort`;
- define internal routing capability
  `CAD_EXECUTE_PROGRAM_V1 =
  RuntimeCapability(name="authoring.execute_program", version=1)` for C03
  composition. This is not a seventh public operation or a portability claim.

Permitted non-stdlib imports are the generic runtime contracts/registry and
the existing backend-neutral `SelectorV1` contract. Do not import
`interaction.cad`, application, workflow, worker, FreeCAD, Qt, FEA,
reconstruction, FCStd/STEP layout or public server/tool modules.

#### 4. Test-first steps and gates

1. Create `tests/test_cad_runtime.py` first and syntax-check it.
2. Run the exact approved command before implementation:

   ```text
   PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
     tests/test_runtime_contracts.py tests/test_runtime_registry.py \
     tests/test_cad_runtime.py
   ```

   Preserve collection exit `2` caused only by the deliberately absent
   `vibecad.interaction.cad_runtime` module.
3. Implement the narrow module and rerun the same command to GREEN.
4. Tests must cover all five exact decision types/invariants, undeclared
   capabilities, mutation-free approximation/unsupported routing with zero
   adapter calls, explicit extension identity, duplicate/unknown/exact-version
   registration, reversed-order fixture identities, artifact role/runtime/
   kind/media mismatch, mandatory semantic selectors, runtime/revision/native
   mismatch, native loss retaining semantic identity, bounded hostile/endless
   inputs, forbidden authority names and AST import purity.
5. Run scoped Ruff/format, `git diff --check`, exact allowlist and
   `interaction/__init__.py` hash checks. Distinct `sol / max` and
   `terra / medium` agents must both PASS.

#### 5. Execution discipline and breakers

The implementation subagent is the sole source/test writer and may not edit
the artifact, stage, commit or push. Stop on any required edit to
`interaction/cad.py`, `interaction/__init__.py`, application/project, worker,
generic runtime C01, revisions/store/schema/layout, public `SelectorV1`, six
operations or 28 tools. Also stop on any adapter authority expansion,
FreeCAD-specific import/field, product-support claim for fixture identities,
unsupported/approximation path that returns or invokes an adapter, or
unbounded public iterable.

#### 6. Delivery boundary

The intended commit is exactly:

```text
feat(cad): add backend-neutral CAD runtime port
```

It may contain only `cad_runtime.py`, `test_cad_runtime.py` and this artifact.
No commit or push occurs until focused GREEN, all five decision branches,
authority/purity evidence, independent review and mechanical recheck pass.

#### 7. Required final report

Return the exact RED cause/exit, GREEN command/count, exact files, value/API
decisions, branch and mutation counters, selector/artifact negatives, iterable
bounds, purity/authority results, Ruff/diff/hash evidence, review findings,
residuals and whether `interaction/__init__.py` remained unchanged.

## 24. MR0-C02 Test-First Ledger, Review Red and Corrective Packet

### 24.1 Initial RED, design correction and focused GREEN

The `gpt-5.6-sol / high` implementation subagent preserved two test-first
transitions within the exact two-file write scope:

1. before source implementation, the approved exact command exited `2`; the
   sole collection error was the deliberately absent
   `vibecad.interaction.cad_runtime` module, while existing C01 tests collected
   normally;
2. after a first GREEN, three architecture checks were turned into tests
   before correction: explicit extension requests, all six approved artifact
   roles and immutable registry-admission descriptors. That corrective run
   exited `1` with `6 failed, 49 passed`;
3. the settled focused command then returned `55 passed`:
   `31` generic runtime cases and `24` C02 cases.

The two new files only were changed. Scoped Ruff/format, AST import purity,
source-assert scan, whitespace/diff checks and hostile-iterable process cleanup
passed. `src/vibecad/interaction/__init__.py` retained SHA-256
`f1e9b6e50b2042c09dff60d024a6fbf53ee09f2507b6b66dfa0423de9ae776a5`.
No stage, commit or push occurred.

### 24.2 MR0-C02-E02 — independent architecture/adversarial review red

At `2026-07-26T03:37:21Z`, the distinct `gpt-5.6-sol / max` review returned
FAIL with Critical `0`, Major `1`, Medium `3`, Minor `0`:

1. **Major — compound authority names bypass admission.** Exact-name filtering
   rejects `commit` but admitted `commit_revision`, `advance_head`,
   `accept_draft`, `reject_task` and `review_task`, allowing a routed adapter
   to expose second-authority methods contrary to D01.
2. **Medium — cross-runtime unsupported extension rules are admitted but
   unreachable.** A descriptor for runtime A accepted an unsupported decision
   whose extension request belongs to runtime B; planning then rejects the
   request before consulting the configured rule.
3. **Medium — singular artifact roles have no cardinality bound.** Profiles
   admitted multiple semantic observations, selector mappings and provenance
   declarations with different kinds.
4. **Medium — generation hook signatures are unchecked.** Protocol runtime
   membership admitted adapters whose `terminate_generation(reason)` and
   `close_generation(force)` require arguments, while application call sites
   invoke both with zero arguments.

The reviewer independently reproduced all four. Focused `55`, Ruff/format,
imports, selectors, decision branches, exact routing, mutation-free rejection,
bounds and scope otherwise passed.

The review red is preserved and is not waived or relabeled.

### 24.3 MR0-C02-FIX01 — authority, request, artifact and hook correction

#### 1. Authorization

D01, D03, D05 and D06 plus the approved C02 authority and compatibility gates
already require these behaviors under A01. A02 keeps narrow correction coding
at `gpt-5.6-sol / high`, re-review at `gpt-5.6-sol / max` and mechanical gates
at `gpt-5.6-terra / medium`. No product scope expands.

#### 2. Workspace anchor and exact scope

The pushed anchor remains
`07c6d6cd0260dcce41711a4a92d47132460571db`. FIX01 may change only the same
new `cad_runtime.py` and `test_cad_runtime.py`; this artifact remains
controller-owned and `interaction/__init__.py` must remain unchanged.

#### 3. Exact corrective behavior

- inspect public adapter names by normalized identifier tokens and reject
  commit-, HEAD-, Accept-, Reject- and review-authority names including
  compound snake/camel forms, while allowing trusted parent compatibility
  names such as `open_revision`, private `_store` and ordinary CAD methods;
- require every runtime-qualified extension request, including an unsupported
  decision, to match its decision and descriptor runtime;
- permit multiple exchange/evidence declarations but at most one semantic
  observation, selector mapping and provenance declaration, in addition to
  exactly one native model;
- validate without invoking that the bound `terminate_generation` and
  `close_generation` hooks are callable with zero arguments; reject required
  positional/keyword-only parameters before registry admission.

#### 4. Test-first steps and gates

Add regression tests for compound/camel authority names, Worker-shaped allowed
methods/private fields, cross-runtime unsupported decisions, each singular
role duplicate and invalid generation-hook signatures before source changes.
Run the exact focused command and preserve a FIX01 RED, then implement narrowly
and rerun focused GREEN, standalone C02, targeted authority/cardinality/hook
tests, scoped Ruff/format, AST purity, `git diff --check` and hash checks.

#### 5. Execution discipline and breakers

The coding subagent remains sole source/test writer; no artifact edit, stage,
commit or push. Do not reject existing trusted compatibility methods merely
because they accept store/lease/revision arguments, do not invoke lifecycle
hooks during validation, and do not add reflection-driven execution,
dependencies or files.

#### 6. Delivery boundary

The original C02 commit subject and stage budget remain unchanged. Commit is
forbidden until FIX01 GREEN, settled-diff `sol / max` review PASS and
independent `terra / medium` mechanical PASS.

#### 7. Required final report

Return FIX01 RED/GREEN counts, rejected and permitted authority names, hook
signature cases, role/request negatives, exact paths/hashes, Ruff/diff/purity,
process cleanup and residuals.

### 24.4 MR0-C02-FIX01 test-first execution evidence

The `gpt-5.6-sol / high` coding subagent added the four requested regression
groups before changing source. The exact focused command then exited `1` with
`19 failed, 58 passed`:

- one cross-runtime unsupported extension was admitted;
- three singular artifact-role duplicates were admitted;
- ten snake/camel class authority names and one instance authority name were
  admitted;
- four lifecycle-hook forms with a required positional or keyword-only
  argument were admitted.

After the narrow correction, the same command returned `77 passed` (`31`
generic runtime cases plus `46` C02 cases). The standalone C02 suite returned
`46 passed`; the new targeted matrix returned `22 passed, 24 deselected`.

Admission now enumerates public class-MRO and instance-namespace names without
`dir()`, tokenizes snake and camel identifiers, and rejects the exact
commit/HEAD/Accept/Reject/review authority tokens. Tests cover both spellings
of `commit_revision`, `advance_head`, `accept_draft`, `reject_task` and
`review_task`, while permitting `open_revision` and private `_store` /
`_lease`. Unsupported extension decisions require the request runtime to equal
the decision runtime. Profiles retain exactly one native model, allow at most
one semantic observation, selector mapping and provenance declaration, and
continue to permit multiple exchange and evidence declarations. Registry
admission binds the signatures of the two bound generation hooks with zero
arguments but never invokes either hook; required positional/keyword-only
forms reject, while optional/default and variadic forms admit.

At `2026-07-26T03:44:48Z`, the controller independently reproduced:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \

```

Only the two new implementation paths and this controller-owned artifact are
changed. No stage, commit or push has occurred. The initial architecture review
red remains preserved; the settled-diff `sol / max` re-review and independent
`terra / medium` mechanical gate remain mandatory.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |

### 24.5 MR0-C02-E04 — settled-diff adversarial PASS

At `2026-07-26T03:46:35Z`, the independent `gpt-5.6-sol / max`
architecture/adversarial re-review returned PASS with Critical `0`, Major `0`,
Medium `0`, Minor `0`. It independently reproduced the exact focused suite as
`77 passed in 1.13s`, plus Ruff lint/format, diff, syntax, whitespace, EOF and
import-purity PASS.

Independent probes closed each preserved review finding:

- public names from the class MRO and instance namespace reject all requested
  snake/camel authority forms; `open_revision` and private `_store` /
  `_lease` remain compatible, and a hostile `__dir__` plus lifecycle bodies
  remain uncalled;
- cross-runtime unsupported extension construction rejects, while a
  same-runtime configured unsupported rule remains reachable;
- semantic observation, selector mapping and provenance cardinalities are
  singular, while exchange/evidence multiplicity remains valid;
- required positional and keyword-only generation hooks reject; optional and
  variadic forms bind zero arguments and no hook body executes at admission.

The reviewer also rechecked exact runtime/version routing, immutable admitted
descriptors, five decision branches, non-executable rejection before adapter
selection, selector authority, artifact qualification, bounded hostile
iteration, narrow Protocol authority and the subprocess timeout margin. No
new finding or waiver remains. The reviewed hashes equal Section 24.4.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C02-E04 | D01; D03..D07; A01; A02 | `not-created`; forbidden | focused 77; Ruff/diff/purity PASS; independent review 0/0/0/0; four prior findings closed | none | MRG1-S04 | review PASS / mechanical gate pending |

### 24.6 MR0-C02-E05 — independent pre-stage mechanical PASS

At `2026-07-26T03:49:32Z`, the distinct `gpt-5.6-terra / medium`
mechanical-gate subagent returned PASS without waiver or state change:

```text
HEAD/upstream:       07c6d6cd0260dcce41711a4a92d47132460571db
allowed paths:       3 exact
staged paths:        0
out-of-allowlist:    0
focused:             77 passed in 1.37s
Ruff lint/format:    PASS / PASS
diff/whitespace/EOF: PASS
process leaks:       0
```

It independently matched all three settled hashes, the exact three internal
`vibecad` imports, zero source assertions, the exact four-member adapter
Protocol and the unchanged initializer. Artifact headings were consecutive
and unique from Sections 1 through 24 with Section 24 terminal; all required
RED, review-red, FIX01, GREEN and re-review evidence was present, and the
artifact made no positive C02 commit/push claim.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C02-E05 | D01..D15; A01; A02 | `not-created`; exact staging next | pre-stage mechanical PASS; focused 77; hashes/imports/Protocol/ledger exact | none | MRG1-S04 | gated / ready to stage |

### 24.7 MR0-C02-E06 — post-stage mechanical PASS

At `2026-07-26T03:51:45Z`, the `gpt-5.6-terra / medium` subagent
rechecked the staged-only candidate and returned PASS:

```text
cached paths:        3 exact
unstaged/untracked:  0 / 0
cached diff check:   PASS
focused:             77 passed in 1.16s
Ruff lint/format:    PASS / PASS
process leaks:       0
```

The staged source/test blob hashes matched Section 24.4, the initializer
remained byte-identical, and the staged artifact retained consecutive unique
Sections 1 through 24 with all RED/GREEN/review evidence and no positive claim
that the C02 commit or push already existed. The artifact is restaged after
adding this evidence; a final cached-only integrity check remains before
commit creation.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C02-E06 | D01..D15; A01; A02 | `not-created`; commit next | post-stage mechanical PASS; cached 3; unstaged/untracked 0/0; focused 77; hashes exact | none | MRG1-S04 | gated / ready to commit |

## 25. MR0-C02 Finalization and MR0-C03 Task Packet

### 25.1 MR0-C02 accepted commit

The exact three-path candidate was committed as:

```text
6c3581bab14434ba7c1301e033e973d59907cc4d
feat(cad): add backend-neutral CAD runtime port
```

The commit was pushed immediately to `codex/agent-stage3`. At
`2026-07-26T03:58:29Z`, local HEAD and upstream both resolved to the full hash
above and the worktree was clean. The commit created only
`cad_runtime.py` and `test_cad_runtime.py` and appended this artifact; the
package initializer remained byte-identical.

The accepted evidence chain preserves the genuine absent-module RED, the
design-correction RED, the initial adversarial review red, FIX01 test-first
RED/GREEN, independent `sol / max` `0/0/0/0`, independent
`terra / medium` pre/post-stage PASS and final cached-only integrity PASS.
No waiver or residual defect was carried into C03.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |

### 25.2 MR0-C03 read-only architecture audit

The `gpt-5.6-sol / max` audit returned PASS without editing, staging,
committing or pushing. It traced the current default path from
`AgentApplication.open()` through `_cad_execution_port_under_gate()` to
`project._default_cad_port_factory()`, then through `build_project_runtime()`.
The application already constructs the default Worker lazily once, verifies
the nominal `CadExecutionPort`, caches that same object and uses it for
revision sessions, snapshots and Task execution. Cancellation, generation-loss
observation and application close already call the Worker's existing
generation hooks directly.

The audit found one structural gap only:
`WorkerCadExecutionPort` already has the required locked `generation_lost`
property and zero-argument `terminate_generation()` / `close_generation()`
hooks, but has no immutable `runtime_descriptor`. Its constructor, twelve
private slots and lifecycle implementation need no change.

The approved narrow design is:

- construct one module-level frozen runtime descriptor from the authoritative
  `runtime.spec.FREECAD_VERSION`, yielding exact identity
  `cad/freecad@1.1.0`;
- declare only `authoring.execute_program@1`, execution profile `headless`,
  native artifact `native_model` /
  `application/vnd.freecad.fcstd` and exchange artifact
  `exchange_model` / `model/step`;
- return that singleton from a read-only Worker property and retain structural
  Protocol compatibility rather than adding inheritance;
- inside the lazy default factory, construct one nominal Worker, register that
  exact object, route `CAD_EXECUTE_PROGRAM_V1` through
  `CadDomainService(CadRuntimeRouter(...))`, explicitly fail closed unless
  `selected is worker`, and return the original Worker unchanged;
- on the impossible mismatch, close only the factory-created Worker before
  raising a fixed `TypeError`.

Imports in the default factory stay local. No Worker wrapper, second
generation state machine, generic `RuntimeControlPort`, public operation,
tool, Task/Revision authority or durable artifact schema is introduced.

Read-only baselines before C03 source/test changes were:

```text
C02 plus nominal/lazy/lifecycle nodes: 50 passed in 2.34s
first approved C03 compatibility set:  375 passed, 23 deselected in 28.42s
second approved C03 compatibility set: 379 passed, 1 deselected in 48.04s
```

### 25.3 MR0-C03 seven-section implementation packet

#### 1. Authorization

MRG1-A01 and A02 authorize C03 under D01–D15. Routine test-first coding is
routed to `gpt-5.6-sol / high`; settled architecture/adversarial review stays
`gpt-5.6-sol / max`; mechanical and process gates stay
`gpt-5.6-terra / medium`. This packet connects the delivered FreeCAD Worker
to the internal CAD runtime boundary without expanding product support.

#### 2. Workspace anchor and exact write scope

Start from pushed commit
`6c3581bab14434ba7c1301e033e973d59907cc4d`. The coding subagent may write
only:

```text
src/vibecad/application/project.py
src/vibecad/execution/worker_port.py
tests/test_agent_application.py
tests/test_cad_execution_port.py
```

`tests/test_freecad_worker.py` remains in the approved commit allowlist but is
gate-only unless a genuine compatibility gap first requires a controller
decision. This artifact is controller-owned. All other paths are forbidden.

#### 3. Required implementation and invariants

In `worker_port.py`, add only the imports and module-level immutable values
needed for the exact FreeCAD descriptor plus a read-only
`runtime_descriptor` property. Derive `1.1.0` from
`runtime.spec.FREECAD_VERSION`; do not duplicate the version literal. The
descriptor declares exactly the internal aggregate capability, headless
profile and two artifact declarations recorded in Section 25.2. Repeated
property access must return the same descriptor object.

Do not change `WorkerCadExecutionPort` inheritance, constructor, `__slots__`,
existing properties, worker startup, locks, generation state, lifecycle hooks,
error translation or FCStd/STEP behavior.

In `project._default_cad_port_factory()`, retain lazy local imports. Construct
one Worker, register that exact instance in `CadRuntimeAdapterRegistry`, route
the descriptor identity and `CAD_EXECUTE_PROGRAM_V1` through
`CadDomainService` and `CadRuntimeRouter`, explicitly require object identity
with the Worker, then return that Worker. Normal composition must not start a
FreeCAD process. A mismatched selection closes the factory-owned Worker and
raises; it never returns or closes the foreign selection.

#### 4. Test-first steps and gates

Before source edits, add three tests:

1. the Worker is one lazy structural `CadRuntimeAdapter` with the exact
   singleton descriptor, capability/profile/artifact declarations and zero
   admission hook calls;
2. the default factory routes the exact internal capability and makes the
   registered, selected and returned object the same nominal Worker without
   starting FreeCAD;
3. a non-identical routed adapter fails closed and cleans up only the created
   Worker.

Run and preserve the genuine three-node RED:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_cad_execution_port.py::test_worker_port_is_one_lazy_immutable_freecad_runtime_adapter \
  tests/test_agent_application.py::test_default_cad_port_factory_routes_and_returns_exact_nominal_worker \
  tests/test_agent_application.py::test_default_cad_port_factory_rejects_nonidentical_routed_adapter
```

Then implement the two source changes and rerun those nodes to GREEN. Run the
two approved C02 dependency guards, both prewritten C03 compatibility commands
from Section 13.5, scoped Ruff/format, `git diff --check`, exact allowlist,
module-load/lazy-start and process-leak checks. Run the managed FreeCAD smoke
and both real Task Kernel gates exactly as Section 13.5 specifies; the Task
Kernel command may not use `VIBECAD_FREECAD_ENV`.

#### 5. Execution discipline and breakers

One coding subagent owns the four implementation/test paths and may not edit
the artifact, stage, commit or push. Stop on a top-level project import that
eagerly imports Worker/runtime selection, a per-access descriptor rebuild,
wrong MIME/version, use of optimized-away `assert`, a second Worker or wrapper,
an edit to Worker slots/signatures/lifecycle, routing of individual lifecycle
calls, a public capability/tool change, a revision/store/schema edit, an
allowlist escape, a test-count decrease, new deselection/warning or leaked
process.

#### 6. Delivery boundary

The intended commit is exactly:

```text
refactor(freecad): route worker through CAD runtime adapter
```

It contains only the accepted implementation/test paths and this artifact.
Exact named staging, commit and immediate push remain controller-only and may
occur only after focused/compatibility/real gates, `sol / max` review and
`terra / medium` mechanical PASS.

#### 7. Required final report

Return the three RED causes/count, targeted and compatibility GREEN counts,
exact descriptor values and singleton evidence, registered/selected/returned
object identity, lazy-start and cleanup counters, confirmation that Worker
constructor/slots/hooks stayed unchanged, public 28-tool and six-operation
evidence, Task/Revision/Accept/Reject and FCStd/STEP compatibility, real gate
results, paths/hashes, Ruff/diff/process evidence, review severities,
residuals and any breaker.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C03-E01 | D01..D15; A01; A02 | `not-created`; forbidden | design audit PASS; pre-change baselines 50, 375/23, 379/1 | MRG1-RES-02 until C04 | MRG1-S05 | packet issued / test-first RED next |

### 25.4 MR0-C03 genuine test-first RED

The `gpt-5.6-sol / high` coding subagent created and syntax-checked the three
approved tests before changing either source file. The exact three-node
command exited `1` with `3 failed in 0.95s`:

1. the Worker had no `runtime_descriptor` and raised `AttributeError`;
2. the default factory returned its Worker without registering or routing it,
   so the selection record remained empty;
3. the foreign-selection branch did not exist, so the fixed `TypeError` was
   not raised.

These were contract REDs, not syntax, setup or dependency failures. No Worker
factory or FreeCAD process started. The implementation subagent may now make
only the two approved narrow source edits; no stage, commit or push is
permitted.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C03-E02 | D03; D05; D06; D08; A01; A02 | `not-created`; forbidden | three-node RED 3 failed; syntax PASS; zero Worker starts | MRG1-RES-02 until C04 | MRG1-S05 | RED preserved / implementation active |

### 25.5 MR0-C03 focused GREEN and compatibility evidence

The coding subagent made only the four authorized implementation/test changes.
The resulting Worker descriptor is a private module-level singleton with:

```text
identity:             cad/freecad@1.1.0
capabilities:         authoring.execute_program@1
execution profiles:  headless
decisions:            none (implicit native planning)
native artifact:      native_model / application/vnd.freecad.fcstd / v1
exchange artifact:    exchange_model / model/step / v1
```

The version is derived from `runtime.spec.FREECAD_VERSION`. Repeated property
access returns the same descriptor object. The Worker's nominal inheritance,
constructor, twelve slots, locks, generation state and lifecycle hooks are
unchanged.

The default factory retains local lazy imports and constructs one Worker. The
tests explicitly prove the registry's admitted object, the service-selected
object and the returned nominal `WorkerCadExecutionPort` are identical, and
that the routed identity/capability are exact. Normal discovery/start counters
remain zero. A foreign selection closes only the one factory-created Worker,
does not close the foreign object and raises the fixed mismatch `TypeError`.

Evidence at `2026-07-26T04:17:54Z`:

```text
three-node GREEN:          3 passed in 0.46s
C02 dependency guards:    2 passed in 0.12s
compatibility command 1:  376 passed, 23 deselected in 21.64s
compatibility command 2:  381 passed, 1 deselected in 46.13s
Ruff lint/format:          PASS / PASS
git diff --check:          PASS
pytest/FreeCAD leak scan:  0
```

The compatibility counts increased by exactly one and two tests respectively
from the read-only baseline; deselections did not increase. A second
independent `gpt-5.6-sol / max` design validation also returned PASS and
reproduced the Worker authority surface, zero-start routing and exact
descriptor values without editing the workspace.

Settled implementation/test hashes before real-runtime gates are:

```text
c686f91dd8189bae92f505ceeb586dc4eec5cb60159c4612dcc2387462d8f5e6  src/vibecad/application/project.py

```

Only those four paths and this controller artifact are modified; no path is
staged or untracked. Real managed-runtime gates, settled-diff adversarial
review and mechanical staging checks remain mandatory.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C03-E03 | D03; D05; D06; D08; A01; A02 | `not-created`; forbidden | GREEN 3; guards 2; compatibility 376/23 and 381/1; Ruff/diff/leak PASS; two design reviews PASS | MRG1-RES-02 until C04 | MRG1-S05 | implemented / real gates pending |

### 25.6 MR0-C03 real managed-runtime PASS

At `2026-07-26T04:20:37Z`, the independent
`gpt-5.6-terra / medium` gate verified the current managed FreeCAD
`1.1.0` generation, exact receipt and readiness, then returned PASS:

```text
managed Worker load/modify/checkpoint/export: 1 passed in 1.97s
real Task Kernel gates:                       2 passed in 17.39s
skip / deselect / warning:                    0 / 0 / 0
pytest/FreeCAD/Worker/daemon leaks:            0
```

The managed Worker command used the exact selected Python:

```text
/Users/wangtao/Library/Application Support/VibeCAD/runtime/mamba/envs/vibecad/bin/python
```

The Task Kernel command explicitly removed `VIBECAD_FREECAD_ENV`, enabled
`VIBECAD_RUN_INTEGRATION=1` and verified that the optional managed-Python
value matched the selected generation. Both real tests executed; none skipped
or deselected. The runtime receipt remained current and `runtime_ready=True`
afterward. The exact five changed paths and all four implementation/test
hashes remained unchanged.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C03-E04 | D01; D03; D08; A01; A02 | `not-created`; forbidden | real Worker 1; real Task Kernel 2; override absent; skips/warnings/leaks 0 | MRG1-RES-02 until C04 | MRG1-S05 | real gates PASS / review pending |

### 25.7 MR0-C03 settled-diff adversarial PASS

At `2026-07-26T04:31:11Z`, the independent `gpt-5.6-sol / max`
architecture/adversarial review returned PASS with Critical `0`, Major `0`,
Medium `0`, Minor `0`. The four implementation/test hashes remained equal to
Section 25.5 from the beginning through the end of review.

The review independently established:

- private immutable descriptor singleton, exact derived version/capability/
  profile/artifact metadata, empty decisions and unchanged `__all__`;
- nominal `CadExecutionPort` plus structural four-member
  `CadRuntimeAdapter`, with constructor, exact twelve slots, locks,
  lifecycle properties and hook bodies unchanged from the anchor;
- authority admission permits trusted `open_revision` and private store state
  without granting commit/HEAD/review/Task authority or invoking startup/hooks;
- one default Worker, exact registry/router/service path and explicit object
  identity in both normal and optimized mode;
- reachable mismatch cleanup closes only the unpublished owned Worker and
  cannot mask the fixed `TypeError`; the foreign selection remains untouched;
- immutable admission snapshots prevent descriptor drift/TOCTOU;
- no eager Worker/FreeCAD service load, public surface remains 28 tools and
  six semantic operations, and no Task/Revision/schema/artifact-payload code
  changed.

Independent reruns returned:

```text
targeted / guards:       3 / 2 passed
compatibility command 1: 376 passed, 23 deselected
compatibility command 2: 381 passed, 1 deselected
lazy module-load:         1 passed
Ruff/format/diff/imports: PASS
optimized-mode probes:    PASS
process leaks:            0
```

No waiver, residual finding or corrective packet is required.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C03-E05 | D01..D15; A01; A02 | `not-created`; forbidden | real gates PASS; review 0/0/0/0; 28 tools; 6 operations; optimized/lazy/AST/TOCTOU PASS | MRG1-RES-02 until C04 | MRG1-S05 | review PASS / mechanical gate pending |

### 25.8 MR0-C03 independent pre-stage mechanical PASS

At `2026-07-26T04:36:32Z`, the distinct
`gpt-5.6-terra / medium` subagent returned PASS without changing state:

```text
HEAD/upstream:         6c3581bab14434ba7c1301e033e973d59907cc4d
changed paths:         5 exact
staged/untracked:      0 / 0
targeted / guards:     3 / 2 passed
Ruff/format/diff:      PASS
whitespace/EOF/leaks:  0 / 0 / 0
```

It independently matched all four hashes, exact twelve Worker slots,
unchanged lifecycle AST bodies, private descriptor/`__all__`, lazy local
factory imports, one Worker construction, explicit object-identity check,
zero forbidden eager modules, 28 public tools and six direct semantic
operations. Sections 1 through 25 were consecutive and unique with Section 25
terminal; all C03 RED/GREEN/compatibility/real/review evidence was present and
there was no positive C03 commit or push claim.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C03-E06 | D01..D15; A01; A02 | `not-created`; exact staging next | pre-stage mechanical PASS; five paths/four hashes exact; 28/6; AST/lazy/ledger PASS | MRG1-RES-02 until C04 | MRG1-S05 | gated / ready to stage |

### 25.9 MR0-C03 post-stage mechanical PASS

At `2026-07-26T04:37:52Z`, the `gpt-5.6-terra / medium` subagent
returned PASS for the staged-only candidate:

```text
cached paths:        5 exact
unstaged/untracked:  0 / 0
cached diff check:   PASS
targeted / guards:   3 / 2 passed
Ruff lint/format:    PASS / PASS
process leaks:       0
```

The staged blobs and worktree matched all four settled hashes. The staged
artifact retained consecutive unique Sections 1 through 25 with Section 25
terminal, the pre-stage evidence and no claim that C03 had already been
committed or pushed. This artifact is restaged after adding the post-stage
record; one final cached-only integrity check remains before commit creation.

| Entry ID | Decision / approval | Commit / push | Gate evidence | Residual | Snapshot | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR0-C03-E07 | D01..D15; A01; A02 | `not-created`; commit next | post-stage mechanical PASS; cached 5; unstaged/untracked 0/0; targeted/guards/Ruff/hash exact | MRG1-RES-02 until C04 | MRG1-S05 | gated / ready to commit |
